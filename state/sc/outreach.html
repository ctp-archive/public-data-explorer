    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We noticed that South Carolina’s number for antigen positive tests is about 40% higher than South Carolina’s probable case number as of March 23. In many other states, even those that say they are accounting for retesting and PCR confirmation in probables, antigen positive test data and probable cases data closely track. Why is South Carolina’s antigen positive test count so much higher than its probable case count?</p>

    </div>
    
  
    <h2>March 17, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We are trying to understand the gaps between state-provided testing data and state-level testing data provided by the federal government daily in its PCR testing timeseries dataset: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Diagnostic-Laboratory-Testing-PCR-Testing/j8mb-icvb</p>
<p>In this dataset, South Carolina's total test count is about 15% lower than what the state shares.</p>
<p>Recently, the federal government said it was investigating differences between state-provided and federally-provided test positivity for South Carolina in its data notes for the Community Profile Report, which are calculated using the same data.</p>
<p>We were wondering if the cause of these differences had been identified and if these problems will be fixed for SC?</p>

        </p>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Why there was a change?</strong>
Large differences in counts and percent positive led to us reviewing the data sending process.** **As part of our ongoing review of data provided to both our State-level data visualization tools and data provided to the CDC, it was noticed that testing data displayed by the CDC did not align with the data being presented on our website. Discussions were initiated with the CDC to review their processes and data sources. This process required extensive review, testing, evaluation of any changes that needed to be made and correlation studies with new data processes. We have recently reached a resolution and the changes have been made to ensure data provided to the CDC more accurately reflect information being provided by South Carolina on our website. Cleaning processes will continue to refine how data are presented.</p>
<p><strong>Why there are still differences?</strong>
There are three main reasons for the differences.</p>
<ol>
<li>We use different deduplication processes. Sometimes we receive the same test twice (or more times), which must be identified and dropped. This requires making some choices, and our processes are not the same.</li>
<li>We use different cleaning processes. We must classify tests into different test types (PCR, antigen, antibody), and how to classify test results (positive or negative) using sometimes incomplete data. This also leads to some differences.</li>
<li>We use different dates of reference. We count tests the day they arrive at DHEC's systems. The CDC prefers to use a mixture of 4 different dates (date of result, date of test, date of specimen receipt or date of specimen collection), based on which is available for each test.</li>
</ol>

    <div>
      <p>Hello -- for the Cases by Race, there is no longer an &quot;under investigation&quot; section in the pie chart. However, the pie chart next to it for Ethnicity does have the &quot;under investigation&quot; group. What was the reasoning for this shift? Should we be reporting the &quot;under investigation&quot; number from the ethnicity pie chart?</p>

    <div>
      <p>We’ve noticed that South Carolina removed the “Go to Testing” tab and “State Recovery Estimate” section on the County Level COVID-19 Data dashboard on February 23, 2021. Is there an alternative source for the data points previously on these sections of the dashboard, including total, positive, and negative PCR tests? These metrics are important for our data collection, and we’d like to identify a source for them.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Regarding the hospitalizations for Asian, Alaskan and Hawaiian individuals there are currently 1% of all COVID-19 cases hospitalized among these individuals. You can only see this information though when you are in the full state view (or a county with greater than 5 individual cases). Individual counties may have less than 5 cases hospitalized among Asian, Alaskan and Hawaiian individuals. At that time the data would filter out and you would not be able to view that information. This information also applies to unknown individuals. Note may can also be suppressed given the timeline you have selected. We are actively working on incorporating more information into the hospitalizations page.</p>

          <p>We currently report total tests performed, not individuals tested. One individual who receives three positive test results is one case and three tests.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Other states provide their COVID-19 testing and outcomes in machine readable format, but as far as we are aware S.C Department of Health and Environment Control does not at this time. Do you have plans to release this data in an automation friendly format, like an ArcGIS or CKAN API or a direct download of CSV or JSON?</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We’re also interested in testing data in units of “testing encounters”, which can be defined as “the number of unique people who have been tested per day.” Under this metric, if a person is being tested once today and once again the following week, that counts as two tests, however, if the same person has two samples tested at a testing center visit, then that only counts as one testing encounter. Are you willing to or are you planning to release testing encounters? If so, will you be able to provide historical data consistently under an automation friendly format, like an ArcGIS or CKAN API or a direct download of CSV or JSON?</p>

      <p>What challenges are you facing in adjusting to the new HHS guidelines? Which metrics that you report were impacted, or could be impacted by HHS procedure changes? How does this affect the reporting relationship between hospitals and DOH? Are there changes in regulations on which hospitals are now required or not required to report to state DOH?</p>

          <p>DHEC has been working closely with the S.C. Hospital Association during hospitals' transition in reporting from the CDC's NHSN system to the federally required TeleTracking system. Currently, the TeleTracking system asks hospitals to report all of their available beds as one total number, not broken down by bed type as the NHSN system had. Therefore, hospitals’ total number of beds reported includes pediatric beds, neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) bassinets, psychiatric beds, labor and delivery beds, rehabilitation beds and others. As a practical matter, not all of these bed types could be used for caring for adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, or other medical issues. DHEC has been worked with the S.C. Hospital Association to implement a new process for gathering inpatient bed availability and occupancy from each hospital in the state, as this is the reporting metric that best provides the number of hospital beds available for caring for adult COVID-19 patients. We've been able to return to reporting out this information daily since late last week. https://scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/hospital-bed-capacity-covid-19</p>

          <p>While DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory doesn’t perform antibody testing, but private labs report antibody test results to DHEC every day as part of their total COVID-19 testing numbers. DHEC has included antibody tests in the total number of reported tests in South Carolina since March 10. DHEC has not included positive antibody test results in the total number of positive cases of COVID-19 in South Carolina. We provide an updated break down every day of testing by serology and molecular here. https://www.scdhec.gov/infectious-diseases/viruses/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/sc-testing-data-projections-covid-19</p>
