    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>(question with links and screenshot can be found in this doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PFG6YUP1awDTq_f7-gEoxw8G6bzbZze9DGopFS4au0/edit)</p>
<p>We have been comparing our data to the CDC Cases and Deaths data (https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36). We found that the total number of cases matches perfectly to the confirmed cases on Maryland’s dashboard. However, in the CDC data Maryland’s cases are not recorded as confirmed cases, and we were wondering if you had any insight into why this might be?</p>
<p>We are also interested in the process of cases and deaths reporting to the federal government in general. We understand from the CDC website that there is a process of the CDC collecting and then confirming aggregate numbers from each jurisdiction, and that this aggregate reporting complements line level reporting (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html).
Can you tell us about the different mechanisms of reporting cases and deaths to the federal government (voluntary NNDS, aggregate counts process, and line level reporting from the state health department)? We are particularly interested in the aggregate count process as it appears to be the source of the state-level data published by the federal government regularly.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>In parallel with doing this switch, we have some questions about the testing-related time series GIS queries that are available from Maryland. There are two time series:   “Testing Volume”: daily tests and positive tests. (ArcGis query)  This time series starts on 3/23.  This is the time series that we used to populate the Total and Positive specimens for Maryland.  “MASTERCaseTracker”: Total tests and positive cases by report date. (ArcGIS query)  This time series starts on 3/4.   The Testing Volume time series is described in the data dictionary as “static daily total of PCR COVID-19 tests electronically reported”. Does this mean that tests are associated with days based on the date that the test info was received electronically in your system?   Both of these time series have a total tests number. We would like to understand the differences between these two total test numbers. Is it simply that the first is electronically reporting only and the second includes all reporting?   We are specifically wondering about this because between 3/24 and 3/27 the number of positive cases (retrieved from the MASTERCaseTracker time series) is higher than the number of cumulative positive tests (calculated from the daily numbers retrieved from the Testing Volume time series) and we would like to understand why that is.</p>

        <div>
          <p>According to our Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Outbreak Response colleagues, the main reason for the discrepancy is that at the time, we were not receiving electronic lab reports like we are now.In the beginning, we were depending on direct reports from providers and local health departments to classify people as cases or not. This means our case count increased while our overall number of actual test results reported in NEDSS did not.</p>

          <p>Our Vital Statistics Administration reports COVID-19 deaths as confirmed or probable. A death is classified as &quot;confirmed&quot; when there is a positive lab-confirmed COVID-19 test; a death is classified as &quot;probable&quot; when COVID-19 is the suspected or presumed cause of death, but has not yet been confirmed by a lab test. Death data are presented by both date of the report and by date of death and may be updated as amendments to the death record are received.</p>
