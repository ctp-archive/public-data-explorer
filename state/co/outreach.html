          <p>Yes, the percent of cases broken out into race/ethnicity categories in the ‘Demographics’ section of our dashboard corresponds to the cumulative number of cases, which is equal to the confirmed + probable count.</p>
<p>The percent of deaths among cases broken out into race/ethnicity categories corresponds to the cumulative number of “Deaths Among Cases” on the top-level banner of the dashboard. That is equal to the number of deaths among confirmed cases + deaths among probable cases. Those *do not* correspond to the “Deaths Due to COVID-19” cumulative count.</p>

          <p>We can pull this information upon anyone’s request from the CDC’s database. Because it is not the state’s database, and we cannot independently verify the data-- we are not publishing it on our website at this time.Throughout the pandemic, CDPHE has prioritized data transparency and provides some of the most robust data in the nation and will continue to do the same with vaccine distribution. Our vaccine database is available here: <a href="https://covid19.colorado.gov/vaccine-data-dashboard">https://covid19.colorado.gov/vaccine-data-dashboard</a>. Colorado will continue to add additional metrics as more and more people are vaccinated.</p>

          <p>Hi Laura,
we wanted to follow up on your request for more facility level information about vaccine distribution at LTCFs.</p>
<p>We’re attaching some Colorado data from the Tiberius database, which is managed by the CDC.</p>
<p>Some background info on the data:
Through the federally-run Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care program CVS and Walgreens are vaccinating staff and residents in long term care facilities in Colorado. The Tiberius database has information on those vaccinations. It is not a state-managed database. As a note, there may be inconsistencies in the Tiberius data. These data are reported by CVS and Walgreens to Operation Warp Speed. The pharmacies update data to Tiberius twice a week.</p>
<p>If you would like more details in the report, please contact Walgreens (media@walgreens.com) or CVS (Joseph.Goode@CVSHealth.com).</p>
<p>Separately, the state receives patient-level vaccination data about the vaccines administered by CVS and Walgreens through the federally-run Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care program, but that data does not always identify at which LTCF facilities the provider administered the vaccines.</p>

          <p>What has been most challenging for Colorado’s hospitals and health systems is that they are now required to enter data into two platforms – a state program (EMResource) and the federal program (TeleTracking). Unfortunately, the definitions and fields in those two platforms are not the same, so it has been difficult to try to align and simplify that data entry process.</p>

          <p>The metrics that hospitals report haven’t necessarily been impacted, but the accuracy and timeliness of reporting has been impacted because hospitals are required to report in multiple tools.

          <p>The state uses PCR tests, which are considered the most reliable. Private providers are using a wide range of tests, including antibody and possibly antigen tests. Those results are recorded separately in CEDRS.</p>
<p>The state lab does not analyze antigen samples. Private providers might be using them. Antigen test results would be reported in the Colorado Electronic Disease Reporting System but are tracked separately from PCR tests, which is what the state uses and is what is considered the most reliable test. They are not currently listed on the website.</p>

          <p>As it turns out, getting you exact numbers of antigen tests in our reporting system is a little trickier than I thought. I'm told we are seeing some in the system, but the numbers appear to be very low. Pulling a precise list would be challenging because the system codes them similarly to antibody tests. We can do it, but it would take quite a bit of time because it would require a line-by-line search. One of our data gurus probably knows a faster way to do that, but he's out until next week. Anyway, let me know what would work best for you, and we can make it happen.</p>

A combined care setting type would be a facility that combines two or more of these healthcare setting types. It can take time to investigate outbreaks, and often this is led by local public health agencies. For clarity and consistency of data, we only report outbreaks once they have been confirmed.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Given that the reported percentages for race and ethnicity of cases &amp; deaths is not for the total case count or death count, would it be possible to report the number it is out of? Something like 'these percentages are based on the 18,000 cases for which we have race and ethnicity information'?</p>

          <p>Hi, Laura. I agree, that would be helpful, and I'll ask if that can be added. You can calculate it based on the &quot;unknown/not provided&quot; percentage, which is on the table. You can also see how complete that data has been over time by downloading the historical case summary files and looking at how the &quot;unknown/not provided&quot; number has changed over time. I think this answers your question, but let me know if I'm missing something. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Data presented on our dashboard represents about 75% of all reported COVID-19 cases. Cases with an unknown race or ethnicity are excluded from these calculations, so it does not provide an accurate view of statewide trends.
The data is for all reported cases - both confirmed and probable cases are included in that.<br>
The state is working with hospitals and medical providers that interact directly with patients in order to encourage them to collect and report this data.
As an important note, race and ethnicity can be challenging data to collect and report accurately if a medical provider does not ask the individual to report the data, the provider is relying on perceived race/ethnicity, which can be inaccurate.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Right now we're reporting anticipated ICU shortages rather than numbers of available ICU beds and ventilators, which are challenging to report in real time. For the hospital data we report on our website, we partner with the Colorado Hospital Association, so they can best answer questions about what they do and don't report and why.</p>
<p>The State does not report this number ICU/ ventilator data for covid-specific patients. The data on this page has been reported to the state of Colorado by hospitals across the state, and is made possible through a partnership with the Colorado Hospital Association (CHA). Because this data is created, owned and maintained by individual hospitals, any questions should be directed to the CHA and/or to individual hospitals.</p>

          <p>With more than 5.7 million residents in Colorado, and thousands of reported cases and hospitalizations, CDPHE does not have the capacity to maintain individual contact with each person who may have had COVID-19 across the state, so we are not reporting recovery numbers. The Colorado Hospital Association has started reporting discharge data, which helps to provide a snapshot of people who have recovered from the most severe illnesses related to COVID-19.</p>

          <p>Private labs are not required to report negative test results. The larger companies like Quest and LabCorp do submit negative results through their normal reporting, but some small labs use different systems and may not be reporting negatives. We're probably capturing around 90% of negative test results. Because of this uncertainty, we are not reporting negative test results as its own number</p>

          <p>We only recently started reporting race and ethnicity data, and it took a considerable effort to pull that together from multiple sources. We will work to improve this aspect of our reporting, but it will take some time as it's challenging data to collect and report accurately. We are working with hospitals and medical providers that interact directly with patients and encouraging them to collect and report information about race and ethnicity through direct communication with patients rather than the provider's perception. Another challenge to accurately reporting race and ethnicity data is that this information is often omitted when cases are reported to us through our online disease reporting system.</p>
