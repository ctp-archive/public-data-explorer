      New York reports long-term care data for Nursing Homes and Adult Care Facilities. Adult Care Facilities is the term NY uses to describe Assisted Living Facilities. New York reports cumulative death data at the facility-level. New York reports death data as COVID-19 confirmed and COVID-19 presumed. According to New York’s site, “In cases where a definite diagnosis of COVID–19 cannot be made, but it is suspected or likely (e.g., the circumstances are compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), it is acceptable to report COVID–19 on a death certificate as ‘probable’ or ‘presumed.’” New York reports deaths as a combination of residents and staff. The state’s data is cumulative since March 1, 2020. New York provides facility-level of data.

January 2021: At the end of January 2021, New York&#39;s nursing home death count surged when the state decided to start including residents of nursing homes who died outside of a facility, like in a hospital.
