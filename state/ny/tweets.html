    <div>
      <p>We are tracking the number of people who have been tested here, which is different from &quot;number of tests,&quot; which is what the CDC has released so far.</p>
<p>Washington has tested the most people and has the most cases (267). NY now second for cases at 216.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 12, 2020, 12:51 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>As we close up the shop for the night, we've been able to track just under 8000 people tested for #COVID19. That's not a lot, and just a few thousand tests got reported today.</p>
<p>We're missing fresh total test numbers from some big states: CA, NY, and MA.</p>
<p>https://t.co/iERV2wLMmu https://t.co/dsb0GejjeI</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 12, 2020, 1:27 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Two exceptions: California and New York. We know our numbers are low there by hundreds, maybe (maybe!) thousands. But it seems highly unlikely to change the <em>overall</em> picture here.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 12, 2020, 9:50 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Some big new numbers came in since our 3/12 4pm update. Thanks to @NYGovCuomo, we now have a total tested for New York: 2,314, with 328 positives.</p>
<p>Washington also updated. They've tested 4,807 people. 426 positives.</p>
<p>https://t.co/iERV2wLMmu</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 13, 2020, 1:54 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>A few thoughts on why we counted more than 6,600 new tests today:</p>
<ol>
<li>WA, which accounts for nearly 30% of all reported tests in the US, did not report before 4 pm ET yesterday.</li>
<li>NY reported total tests last night for the first time.</li>
</ol>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 13, 2020, 11:33 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Closing up the shop for the night. We're showing 19,066 tests. 2,182 positives. Here are the four states with the largest known outbreaks: WA, NY, CA, MA. https://t.co/LrCchHRS3V</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 14, 2020, 1:50 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@joshtpm Washington and New York are driving the numbers. We're falling further behind on CA testing numbers. Now that MA is out in the open, the other big question mark is TX.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 15, 2020, 1:35 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>By known positive tests, the 10 states with the highest per capita number of cases are:
Washington
New York
Colorado
Massachusetts
Louisiana
Rhode Island
New Jersey
South Dakota
New Hampshire
Georgia</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 17, 2020, 11:15 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>End of day, 3/17, we have confirmed cases in all 50 states + DC and 3 territories, almost 6000 in total. WA and NY are now over 1000 cases each. Of the smaller states, Louisiana, Colorado, and Rhode Island look like hot spots. https://t.co/LzKJBXTD0J</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 18, 2020, 3:02 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The score contains 4 simple components:</p>
<ol>
<li>+1 for reporting positives reliably (only NV fails)</li>
<li>+1 for reporting negatives sometimes (e.g. NY, CA)</li>
<li>+1 for reporting negatives reliably</li>
<li>+1 for reporting all commercial tests</li>
</ol>
<p>(All labs have to report all positives.)</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 19, 2020, 2:28 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The other number that jumps off the page is New York's testing ramp. But it's actually 4th in per-capita testing behind Washington, Maine, and New Mexico. https://t.co/HmeRyEjyrV</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 21, 2020, 2:18 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New York accelerated past Washington in per capita positive tests. Here’s the top 10:</p>
<p>New York
Washington
New Jersey
Louisiana
DC
Michigan
Massachusetts
Colorado
Rhode Island
Illinois</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 22, 2020, 2:25 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New York continues to have the highest positive tests per capita, an indication of both the intensity of testing there and the severity of the outbreak. Here’s the top 10:</p>
<p>New York
Washington
New Jersey
Louisiana
DC
Michigan
Illinois
Vermont
Colorado
Rhode Island</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 22, 2020, 2:26 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Based on the 15 states that report this metric: The number of people hospitalized has grown to 2,544, most of them in New York. It’s worth noting: Washington State does not disclose this number (yet).</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 23, 2020, 3:06 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New York’s new hospitalization update did not make it into our initial daily update. It is there now. The state now has 2635 hospitalized people, up from 1974.</p>
<p>We regret the error.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 24, 2020, 1:54 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Across the 21 states who report them, we tracked 4,468 hospitalizations, the bulk in New York.</p>
<p>But Louisiana and Florida also have growing numbers of hospitalizations.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 24, 2020, 1:59 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New Jersey released new total test numbers today, too. The confirmed cases have grown rapidly as testing ramps up in the NY metro area. https://t.co/PARqhvwpSo</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 25, 2020, 2:31 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>California has finally provided an update. It's unclear if the total test count includes pending, but that's a large number of tests—second only to New York—and presumably includes commercial test providers.</p>
<p>https://t.co/GRXIpoPyGh</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 28, 2020, 2:53 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Louisiana remains extremely worrisome — and is just behind New York in deaths per capita. https://t.co/JMfbCnmiPy</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 29, 2020, 7:38 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@alykatzz @rosanna_rago @THECITYNY Our general position is also that the data on hospitalizations and other outcomes is going to be extremely messy, at least for a couple weeks. I would expect a lot of changes and reformats.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 30, 2020, 2:17 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Cumulative hospitalizations up to 22,303, still largely driven by New York. California is now second in hospitalizations, Louisiana third.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 2, 2020, 3:27 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Michigan continues to be a real trouble spot and now has the third highest number of confirmed cases (after NY and NJ), crossing 10,000 total today.</p>
<p>(We don't know nearly enough about their testing regime in the state, either.) https://t.co/5Vf1ymWOMH</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 3, 2020, 8:45 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@David_J_Bier @FT__Dan @J_Gelatt Some of it, I think, is the New York metro outbreak dominating the numbers. But I agree: we’re missing less commercial testing than we once were. I expected the positive rate to go down as we picked up those negative tests...</p>
<p>And that’s not happening. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 5, 2020, 2:22 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New York's numbers improved today with a notable slowdown in the growth of hospitalizations, but we would agree with this caution.</p>
<p>https://t.co/SKmZo4AjoQ</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 5, 2020, 2:36 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>On Michigan. The state has the third-most confirmed cases and deaths (after NY, then NJ). We had not been including their negative test number because the state said it represented &quot;specimens&quot; not people.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 6, 2020, 7:52 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@JPVMan @Ian_Myers @GovMurphy Also, the number of hospitalizations went up by 1000 the next day. Could be NJ is a day or two behind NY. So many confounding factors.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 6, 2020, 2:48 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New daily deaths held steady at 1,182, about as many as yesterday. New York continues to dominate the movement of these numbers, and New York's numbers have flattened.

      <p>@esandeen @supermills @alexismadrigal Not necessarily subsided but flattened in WA, CA, and —perhaps—NY. The waves are overlapping, though. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    <h2>April 6, 2020, 6:05 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@DeKoustav @dwagswpb I would be very surprised if Florida did not have substantial outbreaks—but is behind New York curve by a substantial number of days. Let’s hope not, though. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 7, 2020, 3:06 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Another way to look at this. New York daily deaths have been a major component of U.S. deaths, but, at least today, there was a large increase in deaths in the other states and territories. https://t.co/or3yeGeUTG</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 7, 2020, 3:53 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>One last thing to look at. Here's your bottom 10 states in testing intensity, with the leader in testing, New York, for scale.</p>
<p>If your state is on this list, it may be that your situation is relatively less severe and/or that you don't know how bad the outbreak is yet. https://t.co/bQ6mx9a50u</p>

    <div>
      <p>Heading into our daily update, we wanted to take a look back at where we are with testing. CA did the first early testing. Then WA started pumping out tests. But NY now dominates. (Graphics by: @samirrayani and @tophtucker) https://t.co/dPzCmzYjI4</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 8, 2020, 1:57 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>On a per capita basis, things look quite different. NY still dominates, but Louisiana—due, in part, to a large outbreak—has tested a lot of people. There are huge disparities in testing between the states, as we've often noted. https://t.co/5x75DI44E3</p>

      <p>A better milestone. New York City saw at least one COVID-19 death on every day since mid March. That's 120+ days. Yesterday, after months of communal effort by the people of the city, New York City finally reported 0 new deaths.</p>
