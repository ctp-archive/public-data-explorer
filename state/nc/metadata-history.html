      <p>The metric reported in our API as <code>totalTestsAntigen</code> only includes tests reported after September, 22, 2020. If previous values become available from North Carolina we will backfill the complete time series.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>As of March 6, 2021, North Carolina no longer updates their COVID-19 data on Sundays.</p>
<p>On March 3, 2021, we cleared the history of Negative (people or cases) in North Carolina. This number mixed units, but we kept it because we relied on it for <code>totalTestResults.</code> Now, with <code>totalTestResults</code> drawn from <code>totalTestsViral</code>, we no longer need the negatives field to be filled.</p>
<p>As of March 3, 2021, North Carolina's <code>totalTestResults</code> are drawn from <code>totalTestsViral</code> instead of calculated via positive+negative. This update resulted in a drop of 880,339 tests, mostly due to the removal of antigen tests from the number.</p>
<p>On March 2nd, 2021, we backfilled North Carolina's <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> from the state provided dataset. This added 2 months of data to the beginning of the series (March 17, 2020 to May 17, 2020). This update also separates the captured lumped PCR and antigen tests previously stored in <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, starting on September 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On February 28, 2021, North Carolina <a href="https://covidtracking.com/screenshots/NC/NC-20210228-115701.png">noted</a> that its data dashboards would not update on that day in order to make changes to improve system performance.</p>
<p>On February 3, 2021, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://twitter.com/ncdhhs/status/1357052211252068354">reported</a> that the day's case counts were much larger than usual because of the inclusion of a backlog of nearly 8,000 cases identified at FastMed clinics during December 2020 and January 2021.</p>
<p>On January 18, 2021, North Carolina announced on their <a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard">COVID-19 dashboard</a> that there will be no daily update due to the holiday, and that their data will next be updated on Tuesday, January 19, 2021.</p>
<p>On January 13, 2021, North Carolina reported that technical issues occurring on January 12, 2021 prevented processing of case and testing data into their COVID reporting system. As a result, case and testing data reported on January 13, 2021 are lower than they would have been had all the data been processed, and case and testing data on January 14, 2021 will be increased, since it will include the previous day's data.</p>
<p>On December 30, 2020, North Carolina announced on its <a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard">dashboard</a> that due to holiday-related disruptions and technical issues, data reported on December 30, 2020 was artificially higher than usual and includes 36 hours of data, while data reported on December 31, 2020 was artificially lower than usual and includes only 12 hours of data.</p>
<p>On December 24, 2020, North Carolina announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that their data would not be updated on December 24, 2020, or December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the holiday.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, North Carolina announced on their <a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard">COVID-19 Data Dashboard</a> that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the thanksgiving holiday. However, on November 27, 2020, they will provide data retroactively for November 26, 2020 and we will backfill our historical data accordingly.</p>
<p>On November 13, 2020, the state of North Carolina <a href="https://covid-tracking-project-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/state_screenshots/NC/NC-20201113-113612.png">announced</a> that they are re-defining hospitalization data based on new guidance, whereby hospitalizations are counted by the entire length of stay and not just by length of isolation. This change will likely affect our Now hospitalized metric for the state</p>
<p>On September 26, 2020, North Carolina started reporting deaths among individuals who had tested positive via antigen. We record this figure in our <strong>Deaths (probable)</strong> field.</p>
<p>On September 25, 2020, North Carolina started reporting probable cases which caused the <strong>Total Cases</strong> to increase by 4,563.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, North Carolina <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/ncdhhs-corrects-covid-19-testing-totals-after-identifying-labcorp-reporting">announced</a> a major correction in its <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, resulting in a decrease of more than 220,000 reported tests.</p>
<p>On July 22, 2020, North Carolina started reporting the number of patients <strong>currently in the ICU</strong>.</p>

<p>On Jaunary 18, 2021 North Carolina announced on their <a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard">COVID-19 dashboard</a> that there will be no daily update due to the holiday, and that their data will next be updated on Tuesday, January 19, 2021.</p>
<p>On January 13, 2021, North Carolina reported that technical issues occurring on January 12, 2021 prevented processing of case and testing data into their COVID reporting system. As a result, case and testing data reported on January 13, 2021 are lower than they would have been had all the data been processed, and case and testing data on January 14, 2021 will be increased, since it will include the previous day's data.</p>
<p>On December 30, 2020, North Carolina announced on its <a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard">dashboard</a> that due to holiday-related disruptions and technical issues, data reported on December 30, 2020 was artificially higher than usual and includes 36 hours of data, while data reported on December 31, 2020 was artificially lower than usual and includes only 12 hours of data.</p>
<p>On December 24, 2020, North Carolina announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that their data would not be updated on December 24, 2020, or December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the holiday.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, North Carolina announced on their <a href="https://covid19.ncdhhs.gov/dashboard">COVID-19 Data Dashboard</a> that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the thanksgiving holiday.

This change will likely affect our Now hospitalized metric for the state</p>
<p>On September 26, 2020, North Carolina started reporting deaths among individuals who had tested positive via antigen. We record this figure in our <strong>Deaths (probable)</strong> field.</p>
<p>On September 25, 2020, North Carolina started reporting probable cases which caused the <strong>Total Cases</strong> to increase by 4,563.</p>

      <p>Negative = Total tests* - total positives (where total tests include all data from public labs and partial data from hospital and commercial labs).</p>
<p>On July 21, NC announced: &quot;North Carolina has launched new, more detailed hospitalization data to provide more insights into North Carolina’s hospital capacity. NCDHHS continuously works to improve its data systems and has recently begun transitioning to a more automated system for collecting this information. In transitioning to this system, there will be a small shift in hospitalization numbers - the change over the past 30 days is displayed below. This is due to changes in the system including hospital information feeding in over night being backdated in the new system.&quot; Beginning July 22 this change means that there is Current ICU information available. We will work to backfill its time series of NC hospital data as well.</p>
<p>On August 12, NCDHHS announced a major correction in its cumulative test counts, resulting in a decrease of over 220,000 tests ever completed. A LabCorp official stated: &quot;From late April until last week, Pixel by LabCorp at-home test collection kits that originated out-of-state but were processed in North Carolina were inadvertently included in the manual data submission to the state. We quickly corrected the issue and provided the updated manual reports to NCDHHS. LabCorp’s daily electronically reported data was accurate and unaffected by the error, and this issue does not affect other states or any results reported to patients or their providers.&quot; See the NCDHHS website for more information.</p>

<p>On July 21, NC announced: &quot;North Carolina has launched new, more detailed hospitalization data to provide more insights into North Carolina’s hospital capacity. NCDHHS continuously works to improve its data systems and has recently begun transitioning to a more automated system for collecting this information. In transitioning to this system, there will be a small shift in hospitalization numbers - the change over the past 30 days is displayed below. This is due to changes in the system including hospital information feeding in over night being backdated in the new system.&quot; Beginning July 22 this change means that there is Current ICU information available. We will work to backfill its time series of NC hospital data as well.</p>
