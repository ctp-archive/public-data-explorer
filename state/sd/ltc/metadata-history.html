    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div>
      On August 27, 2020, South Dakota began releasing long-term-care data in their Department of Health&#39;s Healthcare Partner Webinar slides. For months, we pulled data from these slides, but in January 2021, we noticed resident case and death numbers were available on South Dakota&#39;s main COVID-19 data dashboard, so we switched our process to pull data from the dashboard. Around that same time, we also noticed a note from South Dakota that the data on the slides was not intended to be used for press or public reporting, but because the main dashboard does not include information on staff cases and deaths, we continue to get those numbers from the slides when they are available.
 
South Dakota notes their data is from self-reported &quot;touch-base calls&quot; with facilities. 

September 10, 2020: South Dakota did not report Long Term Care data. Data from September 3, 2020 was carried. 

September 24, 2020: South Dakota did not report residential care facilities as part of its total. Data from September 17, 2020 was carried. 

November 10, 2020: CTP started reporting South Dakota&#39;s long-term care data and backfilled it to August 27th, 2020.

November 19, 2020: No updated data released by South Dakota. Totals were carried over from November 12, 2020. 

December 17, 2020: No updated data released by South Dakota. Totals were carried over from December 10, 2020.

December 24, 2020: No updated data released by South Dakota. Totals were carried over from December 10, 2020.

December 31, 2020: No updated data released by South Dakota. Totals were carried over from December 10, 2020.

January 7, 2021: South Dakota began posting LTC resident cases and deaths on the main COVID-19 dashboard. All other data (facility counts, outbreak cases) are gathered from the weekly health care call slides. This week, South Dakota posted this note at the bottom of the slides, “Not intended for press or for reporting purposes.” This is the first time CTP has seen this caveat on SD&#39;s slideshow. We will sustain this historic data to stay consistent with our previous reporting, which has been based off of these slides. 

February 18, 2020: CTP carried all data except for cumulative resident cases and cumulative resident deaths. No updates on Long-Term Care data were given in the slides.
