    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <div>
      <p>As of March 4, 2021, South Dakota's <code>totalTestResults</code> field is taken directly from <code>totalTestsViral</code> instead of calculated from positive + negative.</p>
<p>On March 4, 2021, we backfilled South Dakota's <strong>Total Tests (Specimens)</strong> and <strong>Positive Tests (PCR)</strong> with data from the &quot;PCR Test Positivity Rate by Date Reported to SD-DOH&quot; on the state's dashboard. The updated time series includes only PCR tests.</p>
<p>On February 11, 2021, South Dakota <a href="https://twitter.com/SDDOH/status/1359925746219814916?s=20">announced</a> on the official South Dakota Department of Health twitter that “a large number of COVID-19 test results are reported in today’s update due to IT system updates completed on one of several reporting methods”. As a result, not all new tests reported on February 11, 2021 were reported in the previous 24 hour period.</p>
<p>On December 24, 2020, South Dakota <a href="https://twitter.com/SDDOH/status/1342173217918746626">announced</a> via the official South Dakota Department of Health twitter that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data reported on December 26, 2020, would be the data which normally would have been reported on December 25, 2020, and the data reported on December 27, 2020 would include two days of data. On December 31, 2020, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021 due to the New Years holiday, and that the data reported on January 2, 2021, would be the data which normally would have been reported on January 1, 2021, and the data reported on January 3, 2021 would include two days of data.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, South Dakota <a href="https://twitter.com/SDDOH/status/1332017785560576001?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">announced</a> via the official South Dakota Department of Health twitter that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Additionally, data for both November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020, will be published on November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>On October, 7, 2020 South Dakota started reporting <strong>Probable cases</strong>. This added 473 new cases to South Dakota's <strong>Total cases</strong> number.</p>
<p>As of September 18, 2020, South Dakota's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On August 27, the South Dakota Department of Health included cases from August 25 and 26 in their update due to a reporting aberration, resulting in a 343 case increase. They have provided historical case counts, and we are working to backfill our data.</p>
<p>On July 27, 2020, <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> decreased by 148 for unclear reasons.</p>

      <p>On July 27, 2020, <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> decreased by 148 for unclear reasons.</p>
<p>On August 27, the South Dakota Department of Health included cases from August 25 and 26 in their update due to a reporting aberration, resulting in a 343 case increase. They have provided historical case counts, and we are working to backfill our data.</p>
<p>As of September 18, 2020, South Dakota's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
