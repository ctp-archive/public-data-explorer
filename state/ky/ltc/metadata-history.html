    <div>
      Kentucky reports long-term care data for Family Care Homes, Personal Care Homes, Intermediate Care facilities, Nursing Facilities, Nursing Homes, and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities. 

Kentucky reports cumulative data since March 7, 2020. They report outbreak data since June 4, 2020. Data on residents and staff are reported separately. Only confirmed cases are reported, and confirmed and probable deaths are reported separately. A probable death is defined as when &quot;results meet clinical criteria AND epidemiologic evidence with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19 OR meets presumptive laboratory evidence AND either clinical criteria or epidemiologic evidence, OR meets vital records criteria with no confirmatory laboratory testing performed for COVID-19.&quot; 

July 2, 2020: Kentucky reconciled cases and deaths, resulting in a large increase in reported data. 

August 3, 2020: Kentucky started providing data by Nursing Homes and Skilled Nursing Facilities, Assisted Living Facilities and Personal Care Homes. Personal Care Homes is categorized as Other in the dataset. Prior to this day, CTP did not categorize by facility type as this data wasn’t available. 

January 7, 2021: Kentucky stopped reporting cumulative facility-level data. According to KY&#39;s long-term care page, &quot;Today’s data only contains cases that are current in 2021. It includes all new cases since 12-31-2020. Facilities without current cases have been removed.&quot;

February 11, 2021: Facility total is carried over from December 31, 2021.
