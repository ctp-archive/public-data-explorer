    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <div>
      <p>Pennsylvania’s Recovered is calculated as total cases multiplied by the percentage of recovered cases from their <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx">data page</a>. As a result of this calculation, this figure may fluctuate from day to day. We urge caution when interpreting this data.</p>
<p>On February 9, 2021, Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/health-details.aspx?newsid=1286">announced</a> via a press release that case data for February 8, 2021 would be low as a result of “technical maintenance to the data server on Sunday”. Data for February 9, 2021, will include cases from “catch-up reporting because of lengthy server downtime”.

<p>On December 28, 2020, Pennsylvania's Total PCR tests (specimens) value increased by ~690,000 from 7,202,533 tests to 7,892,184 tests. On December 29, 2020, this Total PCR tests value decreased by ~580,000 to 7,312,858 tests. We were unable to find an explanation for this fluctuation.</p>

      <p>On December 28, 2020, Pennsylvania's Total PCR tests (specimens) value increased by ~690,000 from 7,202,533 tests to 7,892,184 tests. On December 29, 2020, this Total PCR tests value decreased by ~580,000 to 7,312,858 tests. We were unable to find an explanation for this fluctuation.</p>
<p>On December 14, 2020, Pennsylvania’s <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by roughly 297k without explanation.</p>
<p>On September 3, 2020, Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx">clarified</a> that the test numbers they have been reporting previously are in units of unique people and began publishing new test data in units of specimens. On September 4, 2020, we therefore moved the appropriate historical data to the <strong>Total tests (people)</strong> field and began capturing <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On April 23, 2020, Pennsylvania revised down its total <strong>Deaths (confirmed and probable)</strong> from 1,622 to 1,421 to exclude some probable deaths that needed further confirmation to be linked to COVID-19</p>
