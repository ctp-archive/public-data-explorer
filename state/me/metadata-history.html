    <div>
      <p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>As of March 4, 2021, Maine's <code>totalTestResults</code> are drawn directly from <code>totalTestsViral</code> instead of calculated by adding positive+negative, causing a drop of 225 in the daily increase in tests and 41,208 in the total tests, mostly due to the removal of non-resident tests.</p>
<p>On March 4, 2021, we backfilled Maine's <strong>Total Tests (Specimens)</strong>, <strong>Positive Tests (PCR)</strong>, <strong>Total Antigen Tests</strong> and <strong>Positive Antigen Tests</strong> metrics from the &quot;Daily lab results&quot; tab on Maine's dashboard.  The new values reflect testing on Maine residents only.</p>
<p>On December 25, 2020, Maine announced on their <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/data.shtml">COVID-19 page</a> that some of their data would not be updated between December 25, 2020 and December 27, 2020 due to the holiday. As a result, we were unable to update Maine’s testing and current hospitalization data on December 25, 2020, and unable to update any data on December 26, 2020.</p>
<p>On December 9, 2020, Maine’s <strong>Total Antigen Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by 248 on their COVID-19 page, which we believe was an error. The sum of <strong>Positive Antigen Tests,</strong> <strong>Negative Antigen Tests,</strong> and indeterminate antigen tests is 38,632 and Maine reported 36,632. In order to ensure that our data is as accurate as possible, we did not update Maine’s Total Antigen Tests (specimens) on December 9, 2020. (Antigen data is available in our CSVs and API.)</p>
<p>On November 30, 2020, Maine’s Total antigen tests (specimens) and Negative antigen tests (specimens) increased by roughly 11,000, and their Positive antigen tests (specimens) increased by about 400 without explanation.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Maine announced on their COVID-19 page that there would only be partial updates to their data from November 26, 2020 to November 29, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. As a result, we were unable to update testing data, and current hospitalization data on November 26, 2020, and unable to update all data points except for Currently hospitalized, Currently in ICU, and Currently on ventilator on November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2020, Maine did not update testing and hospitalization data: only <strong>Cases,</strong> <strong>Deaths,</strong> and <strong>Recovered</strong> were updated.</p>
<p>On November 2, 2020, Maine started reporting antigen and molecular tests separately on the state's dashboard.</p>
<p>On June 23, 2020, Maine began reporting the dates of <strong>cases</strong>, <strong>deaths</strong>, <strong>recoveries</strong>, and <strong>hospitalizations</strong> on the day they occurred instead of the day the event was reported. Maine also began providing separate figures for <strong>Deaths (probable)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong>.</p>
<p>As of May 20, 2020, Maine reports PCR tests and antibody tests separately.</p>

<p>On November 30, 2020, Maine’s Total antigen tests (specimens) and Negative antigen tests (specimens) increased by roughly 11,000, and their Positive antigen tests (specimens) increased by about 400 without explanation.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Maine announced on their COVID-19 page that there would only be partial updates to their data from November 26, 2020 to November 29, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. As a result, we were unable to update testing data, and current hospitalization data on November 26, 2020, and unable to update all data points except for Currently hospitalized, Currently in ICU, and Currently on ventilator on November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2020, Maine did not update testing and hospitalization data: only <strong>Cases,</strong> <strong>Deaths,</strong> and <strong>Recovered</strong> were updated.</p>
<p>On November 2, 2020, Maine started reporting antigen and molecular tests separately on the state's dashboard.</p>
<p>On June 23, 2020, Maine began reporting the dates of <strong>cases</strong>, <strong>deaths</strong>, <strong>recoveries</strong>, and <strong>hospitalizations</strong> on the day they occurred instead of the day the event was reported. Maine also began providing separate figures for <strong>Deaths (probable)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong>.</p>
<p>As of May 20, 2020, Maine reports PCR tests and antibody tests separately.</p>

<p>On June 23, 2020, Maine began reporting the dates of <strong>cases</strong>, <strong>deaths</strong>, <strong>recoveries</strong>, and <strong>hospitalizations</strong> on the day they occurred instead of the day the event was reported. Maine also began providing separate figures for <strong>Deaths (probable)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong>.</p>
<p>As of May 20, 2020, Maine reports PCR tests and antibody tests separately.</p>
