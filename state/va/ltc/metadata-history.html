      Virginia reports long-term care data for Nursing Homes, Assisted Living Facilities and multicare at the facility-level. Virginia states multicare facilities include facilities that offer multiple types of services (e.g. skilled nursing, assisted living, rehabilitation, etc.). Multicare is categorized as Other in CTP&#39;s dataset. Virginia reports cumulative and current outbreak data. 

Cumulative data is reported in two locations: Virginia’s main dashboard and the Virginia Long-term Care Task Force page on the Virginia Department of Health website. The dashboard only provides cumulative long-term care facility information. The task force page&#39;s data was first published on June 3 and provides cumulative data is categorized and reported by Nursing Homes, Assisted Living and multicare facilities.  Multicare health facilities are placed in the Other category. Facilities reporting cumulative data can date back to January 1. Virginia reports resident and staff information combined.

Virginia provides an asterisk * for digits between 0 and 5 to preserve anonymity of patients and staff in facilities. CTP converts all asterisks * to equal 1 in our calculations. We do this because Virginia reports 0’s for no data, so we assumed an * is at least a value of 1. 

Cumulative data is collected and reported using two different collection methods. To start, the task force reports facility status in three ways: Outbreak in Progress, Pending Closure and Outbreak Closed. For cumulative data, all three are summed together by Nursing Homes, Assisted Living facility and multicare. In turn, the dashboard cumulative total is the long-term care totals. To remove any potential instances of double counting, the difference between the totals of the task force page categories combined and the cumulative total presented on the dashboard is the remaining cases and deaths obscured by Virginia’s  *. This remaining data is placed into the long-term care category. 

Outbreak data is reported for Nursing Homes, Assisted Living and multicare facilities. Current outbreak data is gathered from both “pending closure” and “outbreak-in-progress” facility statuses in the task force dataset. Virginia defines “pending closure” when a facility has 28 days passed without a documented new case and the outbreak has not yet been closed. An “outbreak-in-progress” is defined by Virginia as the identification of two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of illness, with onset dates within 14 days.

June 3, 2020: The Virginia Long-Term Care Task Force published its first dataset. 

June 22, 2020: CTP began breaking out cumulative and outbreak cases and deaths by facility type.

November 26, 2020: Number of Assisted Living Facilities with a COVID-19 case or death decreased by 2.

February 11, 2021: Nursing home facilities decreased by 1. Assisted living number of facilities decreased by 3. Resident and staff deaths decreased by 44.

Cumulative data is collected and reported using two different collection methods. To start, the task force reports facility status in three ways: Outbreak in Progress, Pending Closure and Outbreak Closed. For cumulative data, all three are summed together by Nursing Homes, Assisted Living facility and multicare. In turn, the dashboard cumulative total is the long-term care totals. To remove any potential instances of double counting, the difference between the totals of the task force page categories combined and the cumulative total presented on the dashboard is the remaining cases and deaths obscured by Virginia’s  *. This remaining data is placed into the long-term care category. 

Outbreak data is reported for Nursing Homes, Assisted Living and multicare facilities. Current outbreak data is gathered from both “pending closure” and “outbreak-in-progress” facility statuses in the task force dataset. Virginia defines “pending closure” when a facility has 28 days passed without a documented new case and the outbreak has not yet been closed. An “outbreak-in-progress” is defined by Virginia as the identification of two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of illness, with onset dates within 14 days.

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div>
      Virginia reports long-term care data for Nursing Homes, Assisted Living Facilities, behavioral health residential facilities, group homes, independent living/retirement homes and multicare. Virginia reports cumulative and current outbreak data. 

Cumulative data is reported in two locations: Virginia’s main dashboard and the Virginia Long-term Care Task Force page on the Virginia Department of Health website. The dashboard only provides cumulative long-term care facility information. The task force data was first published on June 3. The task force cumulative data is categorized and reported by Nursing Homes, Assisted Living and multicare facilities.  Multicare health facilities are placed in the Other category. Facilities reporting cumulative data can date back to January 1. Virginia reports resident and staff information combined.

Virginia provides an asterisk * for digits between 0 and 5 to preserve anonymity of patients and staff in facilities. CTP converts all asterisks * to equal 1 in our calculations. We do this because Virginia reports 0’s for no data, so we assumed an * is at least a value of 1.
