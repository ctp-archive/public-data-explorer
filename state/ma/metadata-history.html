<p>On December 25, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021. Additionally, they noted that data reported on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021 would each include two days of data.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their COVID-19 page that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, they announced that the data for November 27, 2020 would include both the data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2020, Massachusetts reported that their data “was delayed today due to a technological issue that resulted in an interruption of the data download. As a result, today’s numbers reflect case counts from up to a 30 hour period&quot; instead of the usual previous 24-hour period.</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2020, Massachusetts’ <strong>Currently Hospitalized</strong>, <strong>Currently in ICU</strong>, and <strong>Currently on Ventilator</strong> figures include only confirmed cases. Previously these numbers included confirmed and probable hospitalizations.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, Massachusetts’ total test results reflect total specimens. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>On September 2, 2020, MA <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download">reported</a> that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 1, 2020, Massachusetts began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> and *<em>probable deaths</em>, causing <strong>Total cases</strong> and <strong>Total deaths</strong> to appear to increase sharply in our data.</p>

<p>On November 26, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their COVID-19 page that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the the Thanksgiving holiday.

<p>On November 25, 2020, Massachusetts reported that their data “was delayed today due to a technological issue that resulted in an interruption of the data download. As a result, today’s numbers reflect case counts from up to a 30 hour period&quot; instead of the usual previous 24-hour period.</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2020, Massachusetts’ <strong>Currently Hospitalized</strong>, <strong>Currently in ICU</strong>, and <strong>Currently on Ventilator</strong> figures include only confirmed cases. Previously these numbers included confirmed and probable hospitalizations.</p>

<p>On September 2, 2020, MA <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download">reported</a> that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 1, 2020, Massachusetts began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> and *<em>probable deaths</em>, causing <strong>Total cases</strong> and <strong>Total deaths</strong> to appear to increase sharply in our data.</p>

<p>On December 25, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021. Additionally, they noted that data reported on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021 would each include two days of data.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their COVID-19 page that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, they announced that the data for November 27, 2020 would include both the data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2020, Massachusetts reported that their data “was delayed today due to a technological issue that resulted in an interruption of the data download. As a result, today’s numbers reflect case counts from up to a 30 hour period&quot; instead of the usual previous 24-hour period.</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2020, Massachusetts’ <strong>Currently Hospitalized</strong>, <strong>Currently in ICU</strong>, and <strong>Currently on Ventilator</strong> figures include only confirmed cases. Previously these numbers included confirmed and probable hospitalizations.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, Massachusetts’ total test results reflect total specimens. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>On September 2, 2020, MA <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download">reported</a> that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 1, 2020, Massachusetts began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> and *<em>probable deaths</em>, causing <strong>Total cases</strong> and <strong>Total deaths</strong> to appear to increase sharply in our data.</p>

<p>On December 25, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021. Additionally, they noted that data reported on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021 would each include two days of data.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their COVID-19 page that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the the Thanksgiving holiday.

<p>On November 25, 2020, Massachusetts reported that their data “was delayed today due to a technological issue that resulted in an interruption of the data download. As a result, today’s numbers reflect case counts from up to a 30 hour period&quot; instead of the usual previous 24-hour period.</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2020, Massachusetts’ <strong>Currently Hospitalized</strong>, <strong>Currently in ICU</strong>, and <strong>Currently on Ventilator</strong> figures include only confirmed cases. Previously these numbers included confirmed and probable hospitalizations.</p>

<p>On September 2, 2020, MA <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download">reported</a> that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>

<p>On December 25, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021. Additionally, they noted that data reported on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021 would each include two days of data.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their COVID-19 page that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, they announced that the data for November 27, 2020 would include both the data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2020, Massachusetts reported that their data “was delayed today due to a technological issue that resulted in an interruption of the data download. As a result, today’s numbers reflect case counts from up to a 30 hour period&quot; instead of the usual previous 24-hour period.</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2020, Massachusetts’ <strong>Currently Hospitalized</strong>, <strong>Currently in ICU</strong>, and <strong>Currently on Ventilator</strong> figures include only confirmed cases. Previously these numbers included confirmed and probable hospitalizations.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, Massachusetts’ total test results reflect total specimens. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>On September 2, 2020, MA <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download">reported</a> that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 1, 2020, Massachusetts began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> and *<em>probable deaths</em>, causing <strong>Total cases</strong> and <strong>Total deaths</strong> to appear to increase sharply in our data.</p>

<p>On December 25, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021.

<p>On November 26, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their COVID-19 page that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the the Thanksgiving holiday.

<p>On November 25, 2020, Massachusetts reported that their data “was delayed today due to a technological issue that resulted in an interruption of the data download. As a result, today’s numbers reflect case counts from up to a 30 hour period&quot; instead of the usual previous 24-hour period.</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2020, Massachusetts’ <strong>Currently Hospitalized</strong>, <strong>Currently in ICU</strong>, and <strong>Currently on Ventilator</strong> figures include only confirmed cases. Previously these numbers included confirmed and probable hospitalizations.</p>

This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>

<p>On December 25, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020, or on January 1, 2021. Additionally, they noted that data reported on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021 would each include two days of data.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Massachusetts announced on their <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting">COVID-19 Response Reporting page</a> that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, they announced that the data for November 27, 2020 would include both the data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2020, Massachusetts reported that their data “was delayed today due to a technological issue that resulted in an interruption of the data download. As a result, today’s numbers reflect case counts from up to a 30 hour period&quot; instead of the usual previous 24-hour period.</p>
<p>As of November 2, 2020, Massachusetts’ <strong>Currently Hospitalized</strong>, <strong>Currently in ICU</strong>, and <strong>Currently on Ventilator</strong> figures include only confirmed cases. Previously these numbers included confirmed and probable hospitalizations.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, Massachusetts’ total test results reflect total specimens. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>On September 2, 2020, MA <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download">reported</a> that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 1, 2020, Massachusetts began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> and *<em>probable deaths</em>, causing <strong>Total cases</strong> and <strong>Total deaths</strong> to appear to increase sharply in our data.</p>

<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>

<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts.

      <p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>
<p>As of <strong>November 2, 2020</strong>, Massachusetts’ <strong>Currently Hospitalized</strong>, <strong>Currently in ICU</strong>, and <strong>Currently on Ventilator</strong> figures include only confirmed cases. Previously these numbers included confirmed and probable hospitalizations.</p>

<p>On September 2, 2020, MA <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download">reported</a> that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>

<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts.

<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>

      <p>On June 1, 2020, Massachusetts began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> and *<em>probable deaths</em>, causing <strong>Total cases</strong> and <strong>Total deaths</strong> to appear to increase sharply in our data.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On September 2, 2020, MA <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download">reported</a> that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, Massachusetts’ total test results reflect total specimens. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>

      <p>On June 1, 2020, Massachusetts began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> and *<em>probable deaths</em>, causing <strong>Total cases</strong> and <strong>Total deaths</strong> to appear to increase sharply in our data.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2020, Massachusetts decreased the number of <strong>cumulative hospitalizations</strong> and <strong>confirmed and probable deaths</strong> &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>
<p>On July 31, 2020, Massachusetts noted that &quot;Delays in the reporting of test results to DPH from multiple laboratories, including large national commercial laboratories, are reflected in today’s case counts. However, these positive test results have been assigned retrospectively to the appropriate date of test.&quot; We will backfill case data for Massachusetts in the near future.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, Massachusetts began reporting <strong>probable cases</strong> weekly instead of daily. This can lead to apparent spikes in the data when the weekly numbers are incorporated, as happened on August 19. Beginning August 20, 2020, we will use the daily total case count from the race and ethnicity section of the dashboard, which includes both confirmed and probable cases, and will backfill the previous week's case counts.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2020 we updated Massachusetts' <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> before August 12, 2020 based on the state's &quot;Tests by Date&quot; dataset, extending the column back to January 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On September 2, 2020, MA <a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-dashboard-september-2-2020/download">reported</a> that it had shifted to using the more restrictive August 6 definition of probable cases released by the CSTE. This change caused a significant decrease in several data points where probable cases or probable deaths were included, particularly the overall case count, which dropped by more than 7,000. Historical data was also affected.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, Massachusetts’ total test results reflect total specimens. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>

      <p>MA reports both the number of tests performed and the number of people tested. Both data points are available in our API, but MA data on our web pages is reported in units of people tested.
On June 1, MA began to release probable cases and deaths, causing total cases and total deaths to spike in our data.
On June 30, MA decreased the number of cumulative hospitalization, confirmed and probable deaths &quot;due to ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.&quot;</p>
