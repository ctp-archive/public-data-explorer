    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div>
      Iowa reports long-term-care data only for for Skilled Nursing Facilities according to outreach with Iowa&#39;s information public officers. Iowa reports deaths cumulatively and cases associated with current outbreaks. According to conversations CTP had with health officials, Iowa defines an outbreak as a facility with three or more cases in a 14-day period. Cumulative deaths include deaths from outbreak and non-outbreak facilities. Residents and staff are reported combined for cases and deaths. Data is updated on an ad hoc basis. 

Iowa has provided a varied set of metrics both directly to CTP and through their COVID-19 dashboard. Iowa provides outbreak totals for long-term-care data and, occasionally, cumulative totals via email to CTP. On November 26, 2020, in an effort try and provide the best estimate of cumulative cases, we began to use the highest outbreak total of cases and subtract the most recent cumulative data provided by the state health department. That difference is added to the cumulative data to best estimate a cumulative number. Because of this methodology, our estimated cumulative case total for Iowa is likely an undercount.


August 6, 2020: Iowa Department of Health provided CTP with cumulative totals, citing 2355 cumulative staff and resident cases, on July 16, 2020. CTP carried over that total until August 6, 2020.

September 10, 2020: Iowa Department of Health provided CTP with cumulative resident and staff cases, citing 2,461 cases as of September 9, 2020. 

September 24, 2020: Iowa Department of Health provided CTP with cumulative resident and staff cases, citing 3,998 cases as of September 24, 2020.

October 1, 2020: Iowa Department of Health provided CTP with cumulative resident and staff cases, citing 4,081 cases as of October 1, 2020.

October 22, 2020: Iowa Department of Health provided CTP with cumulative resident positives. Previously, Iowa lumped staff and resident positives together. From this date forward, cumulative resident positives provided by Iowa are in the &quot;resident&quot; category and the remaining staff/resident positives will staff in the resident/staff positives category. 

October 29, 2020: Iowa Department of Health did not provide CTP with an update on cumulative resident and staff cases. CTP carried forward data from October 15, 2020.

October 22, 2020: Iowa Department of Health provided CTP with cumulative resident positives. Previously, Iowa lumped staff and resident positives together. From this date forward, cumulative resident positives provided by Iowa are in the &quot;resident&quot; category and the remaining staff/resident positives will staff in the resident/staff positives category.

November 26, 2020: Iowa Department of Health did not provide CTP with an update on cumulative resident cases. CTP carried forward the data from November 5, 2020.

November 26, 2020: Iowa has provided a varied set of metrics both directly to CTP and through their COVID-19 dashboard. Iowa provides outbreak totals for long-term care data and, occasionally, cumulative totals via email to CTP. To try and provide the best estimate of cumulative cases, we use the highest outbreak total of cases and subtract the most recent cumulative data provided by the state health department. That difference is added to the cumulative data to best estimate a cumulative number. Because of this methodology, our estimated cumulative case total for Iowa is likely an undercount.
