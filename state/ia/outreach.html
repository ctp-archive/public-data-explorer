      <p>For cases, we want to confirm that 100% is the number reported as <code>Total Individuals Positive.</code></p>
<p>Would it be possible to report the numbers rather than the percentages; we are missing a lot of data due to rounding.</p>
<p>As an interim step, would it be possible to report more decimal places for cases – deaths are reported with two decimal places (2.34) but cases are only whole numbers, so even more information is being missed due to rounding.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Yes, we de-duplicate based upon a case number assigned by our surveillance system. Multiple negative results are carried forward and displayed at the collection date of the most recent negative. If an individual who was previously negative tests positive, they will no longer be included in the negative count but be moved to positive at the time of the positive collection date. Based on CDC guidance, a person may be counted twice if they are positive again 90 or more days after their first positive.</p>

        <div>
          <p>All Iowa hospitals have been required to report hospitalization information since April 3, 2020. In response to the July HHS's directive, Iowa updated its mandatory reporting order (July 27, 2020) and is using that reporting to fulfill the HHS requirements. These data sets are collected at the same time each day. The hospital data displayed on the Iowa coronavirus.iowa.gov website is supported by the original Iowa mandate from April 3, 2020. The data collected as part of the July HHS directive is being reviewed to consider what additional data may be added to the public website. In addition, Iowa has obtained authority from HHS to conduct reporting on behalf of Iowa hospitals, which is helpful in reducing the number of agencies that Iowa hospitals must report to.</p>
<p>You can find the mandatory reporting order and the data dictionary at our webpage:

          <p>Using three cases among long-term care residents allows us to be confident that we have confirmed an outbreak associated with a facility setting rather than detecting cases associated with another potential risk factor or source. However, we continue to follow-up on any report of two or more respiratory illnesses in any long-term care facility to assess whether COVID-19, flu or other illnesses might be affecting a facility. We have recommended control measures for all facilities regardless of whether there are ill persons identified or not. IDPH or local public health investigate and implement additional support and control measures as soon as any single COVID-19 case is identified in a facility.</p>

          <p>COVID-19 is a reportable condition, so our health care, coroner and other partners report deaths that have a confirmed COVID-19 test to us right away so that we can share as much information as possible as the situation with COVID develops.
- A certifier or medical examiner may use the terms of probable or likely when a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is made and testing is/was not possible. Testing can be done pre- or post-mortem.</p>
<p>For the official death records:
- Funeral directors, medical certifiers (DO, MD, PA, and ARNP) and medical examiners document and certify the decedent demographics and cause of death in IVES through secure online access.
- Iowa follows CDC guidelines for documenting cause of death on death records.
- We adjust reporting at coronavirus.iowa.gov as needed to accurately reflect what becomes available through the official death records process.</p>
