    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We think that the cases and recoveries numbers for 3/7 may have been switched, since the recoveries numbers are consistent with our history of case data, and are larger than what is currently shown as the case numbers. Can we get confirmation/clarification over whether this is the case so that we can backfill today's data as appropriate? And also, if possible, could they give us the case values for 3/7 directly since the dashboard is not showing all the categories that are usually reported?</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Can you clarify how Nebraska performs the necessary deduplication to reach the total individuals tested figure—i.e. instances swabbed, day, week, or recording only one positive test per person, but multiple negative tests for the same person? If the same person gets different test results on different days, would you report the raw results as part of the daily positives or do you apply any kind of logic such as reporting only the first negative or positive result per individual?</p>

          <p>Person centric information on our dashboard. This data a deduplicated, each person is counted as a case only once at the time of their first positive test. Negative tests are also only counted once at the time we get their first negative test. Once a person has a positive test they are no longer counted.

      <p>We’re also interested in testing data in units of “testing encounters”, which can be defined as “the number of people who have been tested per day.” Under this metric, if a person is being tested once today and once again the following week, that counts as two tests, however, if the same person has two samples collected at a testing center visit, then that only counts as one testing encounter.</p>

          <p>With regards to antigen testing: We are getting COVID antigen tests reported. Labs with automated ELR report both (+) and (-). Labs that report manually report (+) only. See discussion below: we are party to CSTE and following established protocol and case definitions form CSTE. In the past 30 days we had 74 (+) Antigen tests reported through manual on line data entry We had automated ELR reports with 41/1291 (+) reports.</p>

<li>They pool tested about 5500 specimens in pools of 5 from ~Mar 25 to ~Apr 25, with a positivity rate of around 8-9%.</li>
<li>Those results were not marked in any special way and ARE incorporated into the state’s data more broadly</li>
<li>They used the CDC’s assay with permission from the FDA (Dr. Iwen called it a “bridge authorization” to use the assay in their own lab)</li>
<li>They stopped pooled testing once the positivity rate hit ~10% because it wouldn’t save enough re-agent at that rate to be worth it.</li>
<li>They are now considering resuming pool testing as soon as 1) the positive rate approaches 5% OR 2) they decide they can get enough data to effectively use a predictor variable to get a better idea of which specimens are likely to be negative and thus suitable for pooling (e.g. a university decides to pool test its entire staff before they come back on campus)</li>
<li>From his conversations with other state lab directors, many other states are considering doing the same (predictor variable)</li>
