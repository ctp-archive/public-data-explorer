    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Thanks for the response to our earlier question about the number of cases, tests, and deaths missing race/ethnicity data. When you do find out the exact numbers, we kindly ask you to report integer numbers for each demographic category instead of percentages. If this is not possible, we kindly ask you to report two decimal points for the percentages along with the exact number of cases/tests/deaths missing race/ethnicity data. Thanks in advance for everything.</p>

Please find below the numbers for missing R/E. These values are as of today's update.

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>NV says &quot;Records with unknown values for gender, race/ethnicity, and age are excluded from percent calculations for each demographic indicator. A significant number of records are missing race and ethnicity information.&quot; Without knowing <em>how many</em> records are missing race and ethnicity information, we have no idea what any of the race and ethnicity numbers should be, since we don't know what the N the percents are out of is. Can they please report the number of records with known race/ethnicity, or the number of records with unknown race/ethnicity (which are equivalent, because we can subtract) so that we can calculate what the percents mean? I selected &quot;Cases&quot; for the metric because it's a single select, but this applies to tests and deaths too.</p>

I’ve sent this over to my team to get you the exact numbers. Last I checked we had about 25-30% of records missing R/E. This is similar to other western states (not sure about the rest of the country).</p>

          <p>we have not discussed posting facility-level data; it would be challenging when it comes to LTCF's, as we are leveraging the Pharmacy Partnership Program to serve them. While their doses administered reporting appears to be consistent, we do not have direct insight in the data reported to us which LTCF's are being served. We would need to work with the pharmacies to gain further details there.</p>
<p>We are looking at closely mirroring Washington's COVID19 vaccination dashboard.</p>

          <p>Total people tested is de-duplicated by the patient name and date of birth, and keeps the date of the person’s first test. If a person is tested multiple times, they will only be counted once in “total people tested” regardless of their test results.  If they have both positive and negative results, we keep the positive record.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We only have a record of “Total People Tested (Molecular)” beginning May 13th and of “Total Tests” beginning April 29. Do you have plans to release a full historical time-series for this metric? Furthermore, other states provide their COVID-19 testing and outcomes in machine readable format, but as far as we are aware, Nevada does not at this time. Do you plan to release a historical time series of these numbers in formats such as json or csv?</p>

          <p>There is a lot of data to collect. It takes a great deal of time for hospitals to complete the daily survey and then for the COVID-19 team at the NHA to validate, compile and push it out.</p>

          <p>No we are not doing pool testing. No antigen testing is taking place, of which I am aware, but it is being discussed. I am looking into your other request and will get back to you soon.</p>

        <div>
          <p>The laboratory results received by the Department of Health and Human Services for the COVID-19 Dashboard do not include race and ethnicity information. That information is gathered when we contact the patient and the missing data reflects cases where we were not able to reach the patient, or they declined to provide this information.</p>

          <p>On the Nevada COVID-19 Facilities Dashboard confirmed cases include both staff and residents.Information on the definition of “skilled nursing” can be found on the health facilities page and information on “assisted living” can be found on the residential facility for groups page, both of which include links to the Nevada statute.</p>
