          <p>I hope you all had a wonderful holiday. 
I apologize for the frequent emails requesting changes to how you report our data. Our governor in ND is giving his State of the State address tomorrow, and has asked me to find out if you will have backfilled the antigen testing data by tomorrow? He likes to reference external sources in his presentations of data to compare to other states, and currently the rolling averages from sites like JHU are displaying 37,000 tests performed on 12/30 based on CTP data. (while he liked that that gives us the lowest positivity in the country on JHU’s website, he and everyone else prefers true data)
Would you be able to provide me an update for how long you project that backfill may take?</p>

          <p>I was reviewing your website today in light of our recent changes and I just wanted to provide another update on our data.
Yesterday we began reporting testing numbers for antigen tests as well. The dataset we provide now includes backfilled data for antigen tests as well.
Please see the definitions of the testing variables below.
I see you have a note indicating “On December 30, 2020, we carried over the existing value for Negative PCR Tests (people) while we evaluate the source for that metric.” We use the total tests in individuals to help identify how many people have been tested since the start of the pandemic, so we have chosen not to break this element out into PCR vs Antigen. We currently only provide new individuals tested by either PCR or Antigen. Is there a reason this may be useful in which you would recommend splitting it apart? My concern is that separating out the first time people are tested by either PCR or Antigen rather than combining this figure will count people multiple times if they have ever been tested by both methods.
I also see that you have indicated a”s of December 30, 2020, North Dakota’s total test metrics now include both antigen and PCR test results.” While these are combined in our dashboard for easy visualization by the public, we do still offer separated PCR and Antigen testing as indicated in the public dataset. In your historical dataset for yesterday, you used the combined total of PCR and Antigen tests for totalTestEncountersViral.
Please let me know if your team needs any assistance in clarifying our new data elements, or if there is anything we can do to assist you in interpreting the changes. I understand that it will take a bit of time to backfill the new data, particularly over the holiday season</p>

          <p>Hi all,
I just wanted to check if it would be possible for CTP to update the data for North Dakota’s probable cases to backfill into the actual dates in which these cases occurred. The data necessary to do so is available on our website and in the <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/Files/MSS/coronavirus/charts-data/CovidTracking.csv">link we previously provided you for obtaining our data</a>.
As a result of your method of only using differences between cumulative days, you reported 1,922 probable cases in ND yesterday, while that figure should have actually been 58.I’m also interested if you are aware of issues with other organizations using your data to present positivity based on incorrect fields in your data. For example, I discovered today that John’s Hopkins is using your count of Cases (confirmed plus probable) as their numerator in positivity calculations, while they use Total PCR tests (test encounters) as their denominator. JHU’s website documentation indicates that they intend to only include molecular positives and tests, so this indicates a misunderstanding of the data they are receiving from you. CCed are State Health Officer Dirk Wilke and State Epidemiologist Tracy Miller. The information on your website is used widely by residents of our state, so we would appreciate a timely response in correcting your errors.</p>

<p>(to follow up with if they answer with vague reference to part I): Do you require that COVID be listed in a specific position in part I, e.g. that it is the underlying cause or the direct cause of death?</p>
<p>(one more question if after those two questions they answer generic &quot;Part I&quot; or even &quot;Part I and Part II&quot;): Why is the proportion of individuals with &quot;Deaths Where COVID-19 is Not the Primary Cause&quot; so high compared to &quot;Deaths Due to COVID-19&quot;?</p>

          <p>Before we classify as Death due to covid or death where covid is not the primary casuse, we need the death certificate to be submitted. As noted on the table: “_The number of deaths where an official death record has not been filed. Per state law, this can take up to 10 days from the date of death.”_Our vital records team manages the classification according to these categories, and I am unfortunately not aware of their schedule or any slowdowns on their end—they may have had delays due to the holidays.The categorization depends on the immediate cause of death and other underlying causes, which does correspond to part 1 of the CDC’s death certificate form.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We noticed that the number of patients currently hospitalized with COVID on ND's dashboard is about 50% lower than the number reported by HHS.  HHS reports any patient with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID (n=202, date 10/2).  In the 10/3 update, the ND dashboard showed 100 COVID active hospitalizations. Does your hospitalized total include suspected cases? If so, do you have any information that could help us understand the discrepancy between the two sources?</p>

        <div>
          <p>Your team has already noted that the ND dashboard has been changed to include both those “Hospitalized with COVID” and those “hospitalized due to COVID.” That said, your team’s note does appear to have interpreted the data presented incorrectly. We consider Confirmed Cases DUE to COVID (meaning a woman hospitalized for her pregnancy that happens to have COVID as well wouldn’t count) to be the authoritative figure for hospitalizations. This differs from the HHS figures which are self-reported, aggregated numbers reported by each hospital. The HHS figures may also include people who are not residents of North Dakota, people who do not have a confirmed case of COVID, or who are hospitalized for unrelated causes. Figures more comparable to HHS are reported as “Hospitalizations with COVID” on our dashboard. We do not consider the HHS figures to be an accurate picture of the impact of covid-19 disease due to their self-reported nature and the long list of caveats to the data, as well as significant misunderstanding by hospitals in what and how to report to HHS. We do, however, consider these figures useful in assessing bed availability. It may be noted that there is an impossibility in reporting Cumulative data in the “Hospitalized with covid” category, as this data is only ever reported in aggregate numbers, and does not have allow for any verification process for data quality on our end or through HHS whatsoever.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>ND contacted us to let us know that encounters were up on their dashboard.</p>
<p>The definition said: &quot;Susceptible individuals are anyone who has not previously tested positive, and includes each encounter in which an individual is tested before their first positive.&quot;</p>
<p>We wrote:</p>
<p>It looks like the dashboard definition for the total “susceptible test encounters” covers only negatives. This probably is a mistake— it’s housed under the totals section and the value matches the total, rather than negative, susceptible test encounters in the CSV. Looks like they just meant to say “before and including their first positive” instead of just “before their first positive”. But would it be possible to ask Ben just to double check?</p>

          <p>&quot;Just wanted to let you know that the wording change has been published. Hopefully that clears up the misinterpretation. Would love to see the note about the typo edited as soon as your team is able to verify the change.&quot;</p>

          <p>Summary of meeting: &quot;They are, of course, looking forward to us moving ahead with the plan to add testing encounters. They're going to add it to their dashboard. We told them that we'd QA the backfill data they sent and get back to them with a realistic schedule for doing all the steps.&quot;</p>

          <p>We will be updating the entire dataset to be most accurate on any given day. Generally from day to day there should only be minor adjustments.</p>
<p>Reasons for changes beyond the current day would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Case has been transferred to another state's morbidity after investigation determined they are not in the state.</li>
<li>For tests, an individual was determined to be a resident of another state</li>
<li>A death has been reported late, we report the actual date of death</li>
<li>A recovery has been reported late, we report the actual date of death</li>
</ul>
<p>If this will not work, we can consider alternatives for locking in data each day. However, we believe that when a timeseries is presented it is best to include the actual dates events occur to the best of our ability—not the day it happens to be reported.</p>

We are currently working to add the Test Encounters to our website, and hope to have that publicly available very soon.Please let me know if there is anything that would be helpful as we transition to adding this figure and ensuring that our data is reported appropriately.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Death information is separated out on our website as well (scroll down to deaths). To be listed as probable, a case must meet clinical criteria and epidemiologic evidence with no confirmatory lab testing performed for COVID-19. Or meet vital records criteria with no confirmatory lab testing performed for COVID-19.</p>

    <h2>August 24, 2020</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Do you perform deduplication to reach your “total tests processed” and/or “unique individuals tested” figures? If so, how? (i.e. instances swabbed per day/week; recording only one positive test per person, but multiple negative tests for the same person; etc.)? When reporting testing figures, if the same person gets different test results on different days, would you report raw results as part of the daily positives or do you apply any kind of logic such as reporting only the first negative or positive result per individual?</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in making sure we understand the “total processed tests” figure, which the dashboard says refers to “unique and serial tested individuals combined.” Does this mean that an individual who is tested once is included once in this count, while an individual who is tested multiple times is included once for each test? Or does this refer to the total number of specimens collected from individuals who are tested? A clearer definition for this count  and description of how deduplication is occurring will help us determine whether we can classify your figure as “total specimens tested” or “total testing encounters.”</p>
<p>We define specimens as the number of samples tested (with no deduplication), and we define testing encounters term as “the number of unique people who have been tested per day.” Under this metric, if a person is being tested once today and once again the following week, that counts as two testing encounters, however, if the same person has two samples tested at a testing center visit, then that only counts as one testing encounter.
If your “total processed tests” figure does not fit our definition for “total testing encounters”: are you willing to or are you planning to release this figure? If so, will you be able to provide historical data for it consistently under a machine readable format?</p>
<p>We have been capturing total number of tests since 5/26, and we have been capturing total unique people tested since 5/13. Since 8/19, we have been capturing the new “total processed tests” figure as the total number of tests; if this figure fits our “total testing encounters” definition, we will change how we capture it accordingly. Do you have plans to release a full historical time-series for these metrics? Furthermore, other states provide their COVID-19 testing and outcomes in machine readable format, but as far as we are aware, North Dakota does not at this time. Do you plan to release a historical time series of these numbers in an automation friendly format, like an ArcGIS or CKAN API or a direct download of CSV or JSON?</p>

          <p>We have had no staff deaths in LTC. The spreadsheet I sent referenced positive cases only and not deaths. We are not identifying deaths in specific LTC facilities. If you go to our online dashboard, you will see a heading titled “In City &amp; County – Long Term Care Cases and Deaths.” It will list out the overall deaths to date in LTC for ND (again we had no staff deaths). Today that accumulative total is 56. <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-case">https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-case</a></p>
