      <p>On March 7, 2021, North Dakota’s Total PCR tests (people) decreased by 75 and Negatives decreased by 109 without explanation.</p>
<p>On February 13, 2021 North Dakota's reported <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong> declined by 822 without explanation.</p>
<p>On February 10, 2021, North Dakota's Confirmed cases decreased by 32 due to an <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/news/update-public-health-laboratory-completes-assessment-software-malfunction">assessment of software malfunction</a>.</p>
<p>On February 9, 2021, North Dakota’s Confirmed cases dropped by 62 due to an <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/news/update-public-health-laboratory-completes-assessment-software-malfunction">assessment of software malfunction</a>, from 93,610 to 93,548. Additionally, their Cases (confirmed + probable) dropped by 11.</p>
<p>On February 6, 2021, North Dakota’s Confirmed cases decreased by 36 due to an <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/news/update-public-health-laboratory-completes-assessment-software-malfunction">assessment of software malfunction</a>.</p>
<p>On December 30, 2020, North Dakota began reporting antigen in addition to PCR testing. From December 30, 2020 to January 3, 2021, we captured those numbers combined in our Total Tests (PCR) and Total Test Encounters (PCR) fields. On January 4, 2021, we began reporting these figures separately and revised our historical data to reflect the separate antigen and PCR numbers North Dakota provides.</p>
<p>On December 25, 2020, North Dakota announced on their <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">COVID-19 dashboard</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. On January 1, 2020, they noted that there would be no update on January 1, 2020 due to the New Years holiday.</p>
<p>On December 15, 2020 through December 17, 2020, North Dakota announced that they were resolving a technical issue with their dashboard. As a result, the hospitalization dashboard was unavailable, and we were unable to update their <strong>Now in ICU</strong>, <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong>, and <strong>Ever in ICU</strong> metrics.</p>
<p>On December 10, 2020, we backfilled <strong>Confirmed cases</strong>, <strong>Probable Cases</strong> and <strong>Total cases</strong> from March 10, 2020 until December 9, 2020. We also cleared our <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (probable)</strong> metrics because the number we reported as confirmed included antigen tested individuals.</p>
<p>On December 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting <strong>Probable Cases,</strong> which it defines as individuals with a positive antigen test.</p>
<p>On December 8, 2020, North Dakota  announced that they would not be updating their website due to site construction as they prepare to add antigen tests to their dashboard. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 8, 2020.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2020, North Dakota stopped reporting patients Hospitalized with COVID on their COVID-19 dashboard to “eliminate the discrepancy” between patients Hospitalized with COVID and patients Hospitalized due to COVID. As of December 3, 2020, North Dakota’s <strong>Currently hospitalized</strong> will include only patients hospitalized due to COVID.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2020, we made changes to our historical deaths counts, changing our <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> source from “Deaths Due to COVID-19” to “Total number of individuals who tested positive and died from any cause while infected with COVID-19.” We had originally switched to use “Deaths Due to COVID-19” on July 1, 2020, but because of growing backlogs of individuals with COVID-19 tests whose death certificates have not yet been filed were not being picked up in the figure, we switched back to best reflect the reality in the state. The change caused a 241 cumulative rise in North Dakota’s death figures.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the state dashboard annotation, the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are &quot;Hospitalized due to COVID&quot;. We are using the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure for our <strong>Currently hospitalized</strong> and <strong>Currently in ICU</strong> metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the &quot;Due to COVID&quot; Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).</p>
<p>On November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0">daily news release</a>.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our <strong>Total PCR tests (test encounters)</strong> field.</p>
<p>On August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.</p>

<p>On December 1, 2020, we made changes to our historical deaths counts, changing our <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> source from “Deaths Due to COVID-19” to “Total number of individuals who tested positive and died from any cause while infected with COVID-19.” We had originally switched to use “Deaths Due to COVID-19” on July 1, 2020, but because of growing backlogs of individuals with COVID-19 tests whose death certificates have not yet been filed were not being picked up in the figure, we switched back to best reflect the reality in the state. The change caused a 241 cumulative rise in North Dakota’s death figures.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the state dashboard annotation, the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are &quot;Hospitalized due to COVID&quot;. We are using the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure for our <strong>Currently hospitalized</strong> and <strong>Currently in ICU</strong> metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the &quot;Due to COVID&quot; Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota announced on their COVID-19 dashboard that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).</p>
<p>On November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0">daily news release</a>.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our <strong>Total PCR tests (test encounters)</strong> field.</p>
<p>On August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.</p>

      <p>As of December 30, 2020, North Dakota's total test metrics <a href="https://twitter.com/NDDOH/status/1344329384262451201">now include both antigen and PCR test results</a>.</p>
<p>From December 30, 2020 to December 31, 2020, we carried over the existing value for <strong>Negative PCR Tests (people)</strong> while we evaluate the source for that metric.</p>
<p>On December 25, 2020, North Dakota announced on their <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">COVID-19 dashboard</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. On January 1, 2020, they noted that there would be no update on January 1, 2020 due to the New Years holiday.</p>
<p>On December 15, 2020 through December 17, 2020, North Dakota announced that they were resolving a technical issue with their dashboard. As a result, the hospitalization dashboard was unavailable, and we were unable to update their <strong>Now in ICU</strong>, <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong>, and <strong>Ever in ICU</strong> metrics.</p>
<p>On December 10, 2020, we backfilled <strong>Confirmed cases</strong>, <strong>Probable Cases</strong> and <strong>Total cases</strong> from March 10, 2020 until December 9, 2020. We also cleared our <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (probable)</strong> metrics because the number we reported as confirmed included antigen tested individuals.</p>
<p>On December 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting <strong>Probable Cases,</strong> which it defines as individuals with a positive antigen test.</p>
<p>On December 8, 2020, North Dakota  announced that they would not be updating their website due to site construction as they prepare to add antigen tests to their dashboard. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 8, 2020.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2020, North Dakota stopped reporting patients Hospitalized with COVID on their <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">COVID-19 dashboard</a> to “eliminate the discrepancy” between patients Hospitalized with COVID and patients Hospitalized due to COVID. As of December 3, 2020, North Dakota’s <strong>Currently hospitalized</strong> will include only patients hospitalized due to COVID.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2020, we made changes to our historical deaths counts, changing our <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> source from “Deaths Due to COVID-19” to “Total number of individuals who tested positive and died from any cause while infected with COVID-19.” We had originally switched to use “Deaths Due to COVID-19” on July 1, 2020, but because of growing backlogs of individuals with COVID-19 tests whose death certificates have not yet been filed were not being picked up in the figure, we switched back to best reflect the reality in the state. The change caused a 241 cumulative rise in North Dakota’s death figures.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">state dashboard annotation</a>, the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are &quot;Hospitalized due to COVID&quot;. We are using the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure for our <strong>Currently hospitalized</strong> and <strong>Currently in ICU</strong> metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the &quot;Due to COVID&quot; Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">announced</a> that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).</p>
<p>On November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Confirmed cases, and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0">daily news release</a>.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our <strong>Total PCR tests (test encounters)</strong> field.</p>
<p>On August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.</p>

      <p>On December 15, 2020 through December 17, 2020, North Dakota announced that they were resolving a technical issue with their dashboard. As a result, the hospitalization dashboard was unavailable, and we were unable to update their <strong>Now in ICU</strong>, <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong>, and <strong>Ever in ICU</strong> metrics.</p>
<p>On December 10, 2020, we backfilled <strong>Positive Cases (PCR)</strong>, <strong>Probable Cases</strong> and <strong>Total cases</strong> from March 10, 2020 until December 9, 2020. We also cleared our <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (probable)</strong> metrics because the number we reported as confirmed included antigen tested individuals.</p>
<p>On December 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting <strong>Probable Cases,</strong> which it defines as individuals with a positive antigen test.</p>
<p>On December 8, 2020, North Dakota  announced that they would not be updating their website due to site construction as they prepare to add antigen tests to their dashboard. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 8, 2020.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2020, North Dakota stopped reporting patients Hospitalized with COVID on their <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">COVID-19 dashboard</a> to “eliminate the discrepancy” between patients Hospitalized with COVID and patients Hospitalized due to COVID. As of December 3, 2020, North Dakota’s Currently hospitalized will include only patients hospitalized due to COVID.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2020, we made changes to our historical deaths counts, changing our <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> source from “Deaths Due to COVID-19” to “Total number of individuals who tested positive and died from any cause while infected with COVID-19.” We had originally switched to use “Deaths Due to COVID-19” on July 1, 2020, but because of growing backlogs of individuals with COVID-19 tests whose death certificates have not yet been filed were not being picked up in the figure, we switched back to best reflect the reality in the state. The change caused a 241 cumulative rise in North Dakota’s death figures.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">state dashboard annotation</a>, the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are &quot;Hospitalized due to COVID&quot;. We are using the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure for our <strong>Currently hospitalized</strong> and <strong>Currently in ICU</strong> metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the &quot;Due to COVID&quot; Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">announced</a> that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Positive PCR tests (people), and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).</p>
<p>On November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases.

      <p>On December 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting <strong>Probable Cases,</strong> which it defines as individuals with a positive antigen test. Until we can obtain a time series of the previous dates these tests were conducted, they will all be reported for 12/09/2020. North Dakota also made a number of changes to its data dashboard on this date that might affect our data reporting.</p>
<p>On December 8, 2020, North Dakota  announced that they would not be updating their website due to site construction as they prepare to add antigen tests to their dashboard. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 8, 2020.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2020, North Dakota stopped reporting patients Hospitalized with COVID on their <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">COVID-19 dashboard</a> to “eliminate the discrepancy” between patients Hospitalized with COVID and patients Hospitalized due to COVID. As of December 3, 2020, North Dakota’s Currently hospitalized will include only patients hospitalized due to COVID.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2020, we made changes to our historical deaths counts, changing our <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> source from “Deaths Due to COVID-19” to “Total number of individuals who tested positive and died from any cause while infected with COVID-19.” We had originally switched to use “Deaths Due to COVID-19” on July 1, 2020, but because of growing backlogs of individuals with COVID-19 tests whose death certificates have not yet been filed were not being picked up in the figure, we switched back to best reflect the reality in the state. The change caused a 241 cumulative rise in North Dakota’s death figures.</p>
<p>On October 8, 2020, North Dakota released two figures describing those who are currently hospitalized. According to the <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">state dashboard annotation</a>, the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure describes those whose main reason for hospitalization is COVID-19, and it also includes all those who are &quot;Hospitalized due to COVID&quot;. We are using the &quot;Hospitalized with COVID&quot; figure for our <strong>Currently hospitalized</strong> and <strong>Currently in ICU</strong> metrics, however there are not matching Cumulative metrics so we are using the &quot;Due to COVID&quot; Cumulative hospitalized and ICU figures.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota explained that higher than normal fluctuations may be seen in data from the week of November 9, 2020, due to a software issue which has been resolved.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, North Dakota <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/north-dakota-coronavirus-cases">announced</a> that the high number of tests and positives was due in part to 5600 test backlog experienced by a third-party lab.</p>
<p>On November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Positive PCR tests (people), and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).</p>
<p>On November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Positive PCR tests (people), and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their <a href="https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0">daily news release</a>.</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our <strong>Total PCR tests (test encounters)</strong> field.</p>
<p>On August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.</p>

<p>On November 11, 2020, North Dakota reported two days of data for all metrics except for Total PCR tests (specimens), Positive PCR tests (people), and Positive cases (confirmed + probable).</p>
<p>On November 10, 2020, North Dakota reported that their software for hospitalization metrics was down, an issue which also impacts active cases. We updated Total PCR tests (specimens), Positive PCR tests (people), and Positive cases (confirmed + probable) from their [daily news release] (https://www.health.nd.gov/news/covid-19-test-results-0).</p>
<p>As of September 11, 2020, North Dakota’s total test results reflect total test encounters. The number of unique people tested is available in our API as <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our <strong>Total PCR tests (test encounters)</strong> field.</p>
<p>On August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.</p>
<p>On May 3, 2020, North Dakota began reporting two additional <strong>death</strong> metrics: deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death records are still pending and deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death certificates do not list COVID-19 as a cause of death. As of July 1, 2020, we have edited our historical figures to exclude these numbers from our death counts, resulting in an apparent drop from 24 deaths on May 2 to 16 on May 3.</p>

      <p>On May 3, 2020, North Dakota began reporting two additional <strong>death</strong> metrics: deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death records are still pending and deaths of people with lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 whose death certificates do not list COVID-19 as a cause of death. As of July 1, 2020, we have edited our historical figures to exclude these numbers from our death counts, resulting in an apparent drop from 24 deaths on May 2 to 16 on May 3.</p>
<p>On August 19, 2020, North Dakota launched a new dashboard with a number of new data points, including race and ethnicity data and ICU data.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2020, North Dakota began reporting “Susceptible Encounters” on its dashboard, which are defined as test encounters excluding those who have tested positive after the first time. We have begun recording the value in our <strong>Total PCR tests (test encounters)</strong> field.</p>

There is a possible typo in the definition on North Dakota’s dashboard making the number appear as if it is negative test encounters, but the value matches the total test encounters rather than the negative test encounters value in North Dakota’s raw data.
