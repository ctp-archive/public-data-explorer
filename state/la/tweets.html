    <h2>March 14, 2020, 1:41 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The biggest news today is that we got a fresh total test number from MA, which had been lacking. We do not have a fresh number for Washington State, which is doing the most testing. Among smaller states, the situations in Louisiana and Colorado stand out. https://t.co/qSmFF4SLva</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 15, 2020, 1:35 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>By known positive tests, the 10 states with the highest per capita number of cases are:
Washington
New York
Colorado
Massachusetts
Louisiana
Rhode Island
New Jersey
South Dakota
New Hampshire
Georgia</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 17, 2020, 11:15 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>End of day, 3/17, we have confirmed cases in all 50 states + DC and 3 territories, almost 6000 in total. WA and NY are now over 1000 cases each. Of the smaller states, Louisiana, Colorado, and Rhode Island look like hot spots. https://t.co/LzKJBXTD0J</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 21, 2020, 2:18 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New York accelerated past Washington in per capita positive tests. Here’s the top 10:</p>
<p>New York
Washington
New Jersey
Louisiana
DC
Michigan
Massachusetts
Colorado
Rhode Island
Illinois</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 22, 2020, 2:25 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New York continues to have the highest positive tests per capita, an indication of both the intensity of testing there and the severity of the outbreak. Here’s the top 10:</p>
<p>New York
Washington
New Jersey
Louisiana
DC
Michigan
Illinois
Vermont
Colorado
Rhode Island</p>

      <p>@NateSilver538 The other thing I’d put on your radar is an emerging southern cluster: look at the per cap numbers for LA, MS, TN. (I think those are the 3 I noticed last run.) -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 22, 2020, 3:39 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@1billy1 @NateSilver538 @alexismadrigal I believe it. We have been very concerned about Louisiana since the first day of the project.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 24, 2020, 1:54 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Across the 21 states who report them, we tracked 4,468 hospitalizations, the bulk in New York.</p>
<p>But Louisiana and Florida also have growing numbers of hospitalizations.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 24, 2020, 1:59 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Louisiana's situation is particularly worrisome. They have not done that much testing and they have high case, hospitalization, and death numbers. https://t.co/UW3kLJKS8b</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 28, 2020, 2:53 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Louisiana remains extremely worrisome — and is just behind New York in deaths per capita. https://t.co/JMfbCnmiPy</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 30, 2020, 2:17 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Cumulative hospitalizations up to 22,303, still largely driven by New York. California is now second in hospitalizations, Louisiana third.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 6, 2020, 2:55 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Some unexpected numbers came from Indiana today. Despite only having ~5000 confirmed cases, the state said today it has 924 COVID patients in the ICU and 500 on ventilators. That's not too far from California's ICU count and closing in on Pennsylvania and Louisiana's vent usage.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 6, 2020, 5:50 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>As of today, 8 states are reporting racial demographics for COVID cases:
CT, IL, MI, MN, NC, NJ, SC, VA</p>
<p>And 5 states are reporting racial demographics for COVID deaths:
CT, IL, LA, MN, NC</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 7, 2020, 3:11 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>This is just another indication that COVID-19, while it broke out on the east and west coasts, will not remain a coastal phenomenon, as Michigan, Louisiana, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, and other states experience intense outbreaks.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 8, 2020, 1:57 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>On a per capita basis, things look quite different. NY still dominates, but Louisiana—due, in part, to a large outbreak—has tested a lot of people. There are huge disparities in testing between the states, as we've often noted. https://t.co/5x75DI44E3</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>May 28, 2020, 2:21 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The big numbers were driven by a few big data dumps. New York and Louisiana were way above average. But 15 states reported over 10k tests.</p>
<p>Unclear how much of the new variability in the numbers is due to states pulling out antibody testing and how much was just Memorial Day. https://t.co/U6a3DY6tpv</p>

      <p>We are seeing new hospitalization highs in Texas, Arizona, and North Carolina. We're showing Louisiana here as well for context, since it had an early COVID-19 outbreak. https://t.co/BvbW8DYEyt</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 17, 2020, 3:35 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Among states that had an early outbreak, most are now in decent shape with lots of testing and very new cases. NY, for example, had a positive rate under 1% today.</p>
<p>Louisiana may be an exception. Cases are rising again and now hospitalizations have stopped falling, too. https://t.co/TSt030hhbN</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 27, 2020, 2:47 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>This is the state of things now.</p>
<p>(Note that OR, KS, KY LA, PA, NH, and RI did not report any new cases today.) https://t.co/hgR7FfanYk</p>

      <p>The record new cases are coming from many states. Notable jumps in Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South Carolina. (Ohio looks bad today but this number is for two days.) https://t.co/L6CJXXbuuP</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 4, 2020, 3:11 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Our daily update is published. We see slightly lower numbers than earlier in the week, probably due to the holiday weekend. 6 states (CT, KS, KY, LA, MN, RI) did not report at all, and some others had lower numbers than usual.</p>
<p>Still: states reported 52k new cases. https://t.co/x830ffyPzh</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 8, 2020, 5:04 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>California set a new record for cases, but some of it was backlog from LA County. COVID-19 hospitalizations are at an all-time high, too. https://t.co/9joV9UASP0</p>

    <h2>July 10, 2020, 3:26 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>At the peak in New York on April 15, that state hit 595 cases per million.</p>
<p>Arizona (580) <em>and</em> Louisiana (568) approached that number today. https://t.co/MxvPqIC43k</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 12, 2020, 3:23 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Florida didn't just break the record for reported cases. It also shattered the mark for cases per million population. New York, at peak, hit 595. Today, Florida reported 712 cases per million. Arkansas also entered the 500+ tier, where we've only seen FL, AZ, and LA. https://t.co/KeQmHMA9as</p>

    <h2>July 18, 2020, 3:40 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Today, ID is back, but we’re missing hospitalization updates from states including AL, AR, CT, IA, LA, MI, MO, MS, NH, OR, RI, SC, and WY. Some due to the new HHS directive, others because it’s the weekend.</p>
<p>We will keep reporting on the availability of this data.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 20, 2020, 3:11 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Populous states can generate large case counts, but if you look at the new cases per million today, 9 smaller states are showing more cases per million than California or Texas: AL, AR, ID, KS, KY, LA, MS, NV, and SC. https://t.co/1pYW6cWRaS</p>

    </div>

<p>One positive thread: compare the hospitalizations to cases charts and it's clear we're diagnosing more infections.</p>
<p>On 4/2, LA's first peak, they did 5,300 tests. Today, 33,620. https://t.co/rgmowepkFE</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>August 2, 2020, 3:50 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Something to watch out for: Some states have stopped reporting on both weekend days. For example, Louisiana didn't report yesterday, so today's numbers for the state are inflated. https://t.co/KZ78GZFNe7</p>

      <p>We’re still compiling data on COVID-19’s spread through long-term care facilities. Complicating the effort recently: Florida went nearly three weeks without releasing long-term care death data, and Louisiana’s cumulative counts appeared to drop with facilities marked as “closed.”</p>
