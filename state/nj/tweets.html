      <p>Among individual states, two stand out for different reasons. First, New Jersey's case total jumped from 267 to 427. Unfortunately, they only report total tests by their own public health lab, so we don't know the true denominator for the positives. https://t.co/NGrSCgFldX</p>

      <p>New York continues to have the highest positive tests per capita, an indication of both the intensity of testing there and the severity of the outbreak. Here’s the top 10:</p>
<p>New York
Washington
New Jersey
Louisiana

    <h2>March 25, 2020, 2:20 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Over the past two days, it is worth noting that two large states have begun reporting more complete testing data. NJ yesterday and OH today both moved the numbers.</p>
<p>CA remains a major question mark. We hope to see movement there later today.</p>
<p>WA is not yet reporting outcomes.</p>

    </div>

      <p>Michigan continues to be a real trouble spot and now has the third highest number of confirmed cases (after NY and NJ), crossing 10,000 total today.</p>
<p>(We don't know nearly enough about their testing regime in the state, either.) https://t.co/5Vf1ymWOMH</p>

    <h2>April 5, 2020, 2:36 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>On Michigan. The state has the third-most confirmed cases and deaths (after NY, then NJ). We had not been including their negative test number because the state said it represented &quot;specimens&quot; not people.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 6, 2020, 7:52 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@JPVMan @Ian_Myers @GovMurphy Also, the number of hospitalizations went up by 1000 the next day. Could be NJ is a day or two behind NY. So many confounding factors.</p>

      <p>One thing to note about hospitalization data: New Jersey, Illinois, and California are all including  different sets of people in their numbers. We are reporting the <em>lower</em> numbers where they are available (as in CA, which breaks out confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases).</p>

    <h2>May 4, 2020, 3:08 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>New Jersey has been adding probable deaths to its backlog. We put them in our raw data, but have kept it out of these charts, so that it’s easier to see the current trends.

      <p>Data on current hospitalizations remains iffy. Today we saw hospitalization numbers in ID and NJ drop by ~50%, which seems unlikely to reflect reality. Some states with rising cases have dropping hosp. figures.</p>
