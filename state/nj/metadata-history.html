    <div>
      <p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for New Jersey reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>New Jersey does not update their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> everyday. If <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> is not updated, we are unable to update their <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, which is calculated as <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> minus <strong>Confirmed cases</strong>.</p>
<p>On March 6, 2021, New Jersey’s Ever hospitalized decreased by 916 without explanation.</p>
<p>On February 8, 2021, New Jersey <a href="https://twitter.com/GovMurphy/status/1358841345859870721">reported</a> that today's data is artificially low due to electronic lab reporting issues. Data reported on February 9, 2021 is expected to correct the backlog.</p>
<p>On January 15, 2021, New Jersey’s Probable cases decreased from 59,881 to 31,717 on their <a href="https://covid19.nj.gov/#live-updates">data dashboard</a> without explanation. We believe this decrease may have been a mistake and sourced this data point from the <a href="https://services7.arcgis.com/Z0rixLlManVefxqY/arcgis/rest/services/DailyCaseCounts/Feat%5B%E2%80%A6%5D27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27TOTAL_AG_CASES%27%7D%5D">underlying data layer</a> (today's value is 60,791) in order to avoid the decrease.</p>
<p>On January 8, 2021 New Jersey’s Probable cases increased from 53,967 to 72,123 without explanation. This affected their Cases (confirmed + probable), which is calculated as Confirmed cases plus Probable cases in the absence of an explicit total case number. On January 9, 2021, their Probable cases decreased from 72,123 to 56,147. Because of this, we believe that the figure reported on January 8, 2021 was a mistake, and have corrected the number in our timeseries.</p>
<p>On October 23, New Jersey's reported <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong> value increased dramatically from 24,517 to 37,222 with no explanation we could find: this was probably a one-time addition of backlogged data.</p>
<p>On August 7, 2020, we back-filled New Jersey's <strong>Probable deaths</strong> with data provided by the state. This removed apparent spikes in deaths due to the state's irregular reporting.</p>
<p>On August 4, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> number decreased by 268 people.</p>
<p>On July 19, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Total cases</strong> decreased, perhaps due to reclassification of probable cases.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Recovered</strong> figure decreased.</p>
<p>On May 16, 2020, a backfill effort by New Jersey caused the state's data for <strong>Recovered</strong> to rise by approximately 7,000 people.</p>

      <p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for New Jersey reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On January 15, 2021, New Jersey’s Probable cases decreased from 59,881 to 31,717 on their <a href="https://covid19.nj.gov/#live-updates">data dashboard</a> without explanation. We believe this decrease may have been a mistake and sourced this data point from the <a href="https://services7.arcgis.com/Z0rixLlManVefxqY/arcgis/rest/services/DailyCaseCounts/Feat%5B%E2%80%A6%5D27%2C+%27onStatisticField%27%3A+%27TOTAL_AG_CASES%27%7D%5D">underlying data layer</a> (today's value is 60,791) in order to avoid the decrease.</p>
<p>On January 8, 2021 New Jersey’s Probable cases increased from 53,967 to 72,123 without explanation. This affected their Cases (confirmed + probable), which is calculated as Confirmed cases plus Probable cases in the absence of an explicit total case number. On January 9, 2021, their Probable cases decreased from 72,123 to 56,147. Because of this, we believe that the figure reported on January 8, 2021 was a mistake, and are correcting the number in our timeseries.</p>
<p>On October 23, New Jersey's reported <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong> value increased dramatically from 24,517 to 37,222 with no explanation we could find: this was probably a one-time addition of backlogged data.</p>
<p>On September 1, New Jersey did not update their total PCR test figure by the time of our update, however total cases increased from 191,160 to 192,290.</p>
<p>On August 7, 2020, we back-filled New Jersey's <strong>Probable deaths</strong> with data provided by the state. This removed apparent spikes in deaths due to the state's irregular reporting.</p>
<p>On August 4, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> number decreased by 268 people.</p>
<p>On July 19, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Total cases</strong> decreased, perhaps due to reclassification of probable cases.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Recovered</strong> figure decreased.</p>
<p>On May 16, 2020, a backfill effort by New Jersey caused the state's data for <strong>Recovered</strong> to rise by approximately 7,000 people.</p>

    <div>
      <p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for New Jersey reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On October 23, New Jersey's reported <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong> value increased dramatically from 24,517 to 37,222 with no explanation we could find: this was probably a one-time addition of backlogged data.</p>
<p>On September 1, New Jersey did not update their total PCR test figure by the time of our update, however total cases increased from 191,160 to 192,290.</p>
<p>On August 7, 2020, we back-filled New Jersey's <strong>Probable deaths</strong> with data provided by the state. This removed apparent spikes in deaths due to the state's irregulat reporting.</p>
<p>On August 4, 2020, New Jersey's <em>Now hospitalized</em>* number decreased by 268 people.</p>
<p>On July 19, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Total cases</strong> decreased, perhaps due to reclassification of probable cases.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Recovered</strong> figure decreased.</p>
<p>On May 16, 2020, a backfill effort by New Jersey caused the state's data for <strong>Recovered</strong> to rise by approximately 7,000 people.</p>

      <p>On May 16, 2020, a backfill effort by New Jersey caused the state's data for <strong>Recovered</strong> to rise by approximately 7,000 people.</p>
<p>On July 16, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Recovered</strong> figure decreased.</p>
<p>On July 19, 2020, New Jersey's <strong>Total cases</strong> decreased, perhaps due to reclassification of probable cases.</p>
<p>On August 4, 2020, New Jersey's <em>Now hospitalized</em>* number decreased by 268 people.</p>
<p>On August 7, 2020, we back-filled New Jersey's <strong>Probable deaths</strong> with data provided by the state. This removed apparent spikes in deaths due to the state's irregulat reporting.</p>
<p>On September 1, New Jersey did not update their total PCR test figure by the time of our update, however total cases increased from 191160 to 192290.</p>
<p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for New Jersey reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.</p>

      <p>&quot;Positive count includes deaths. Hospitalization + ICU counts include both positive cases and persons under investigation. As of May 11, New Jersey is reporting total PCR specimens tested.</p>
<p>On May 16, New Jersey had a significant jump in recovered (about 7,000) due to backfilling previous days after a shift in how this figure was reported on April 28.</p>
<p>On July 16, New Jersey decreased the number of cumulative recoveries.</p>
<p>On July 19, New Jersey reported 31 fewer cases than the preceding day. We believe this drop was due to reclassifying probable cases.</p>
<p>On July 20, New Jersey decreased the number of cumulative hospitalizations.</p>
<p>On August 4, New Jersey reported current hospitalizations of 470, down from the previous report of 738 on August 3</p>
<p>Beginning on August 5, New Jersey is not publishing the PDF in which it usually reports Cumulative Hospitalized.&quot;</p>
<p>On August 7th, we backfilled New Jersey's probable deaths based on a state-provided time series of probable deaths by death date. We also updated historical values for the total death column so that it combines confirmed deaths by date reported on the NJ dashboard with probable deaths by death date. This removed some previous dramatic changes in the total death number that were due to sporadic reporting of probable deaths (e.g. 1854 all reported on June 25, decreases in deaths on 7/22 and 7/29, etc.).</p>
