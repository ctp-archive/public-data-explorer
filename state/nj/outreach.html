    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Yesterday (10/18) our team discovered that demographic data for NJ's cases, deaths, and hospitalizations was inaccessible unless we had a Tableau login. We're wondering whether this might be resolved soon? Or maybe there's another way for us to access this information? We record demographic data regularly, so it would be really helpful for us to have access to the data.</p>

          <p>If by “outcomes” you mean hospitalizations and deaths, at this time we do not allow machine readable format due to concerns that this will have confidentiality issues (ability to see small numbers behind certain outcomes on certain days). We are exploring ways to allow this to happen without jeopardizing confidentiality.</p>

        <div>
          <p>When the Department gets positive test results, we work to “de-duplicate” them so that each positive individual is counted as a case only once. Total PCR tests reported are just that – the total number of tests performed (not the number of patients tested and not de-duped).</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>

      <p>When reporting testing results, if the same person gets different test results on different days, would you report raw results as part of the daily positives or do you apply any kind of logic such as reporting only the first negative or positive result per individual?</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>

      <p>We’re also interested in testing data in units of “testing encounters”, which can be defined as “the number of unique people who have been tested per day.” Under this metric, if a person is being tested once today and once again the following week, that counts as two tests, however, if the same person has two samples tested at a testing center visit, then that only counts as one testing encounter. Are you willing to or are you planning to release testing encounters?</p>

          <p>The state is not performing pooled testing at this time. Three commercial labs that we partner with (Bioreference, Quest and LabCorp) are all pooling some of their specimens using a variety of molecular test methods. Tests are reported individually for each patient (if four specimens in a pool test negative, a negative result is reported for each patient; if a pool is positive, the individual specimens in the pool are retested and results reported individually for each patient).</p>

        <div>
          <p>We are reporting the number of probable deaths separately from confirmed deaths for a number of reasons. On our dashboard and on your site, you list the number of &quot;new deaths reported today.&quot; Probable deaths in NJ are not going to be reported in this format – there is no &quot;new probable deaths today&quot; indicator. We will be updating the cumulative number of probable deaths on the dashboard weekly. Since the &quot;reported today&quot; format you are using to share this information isn't compatible with how we will be reporting them, you may not want to include probable deaths in the daily counts on your website.
If you decide to include them, we recommend that you reference the weekly update timeframe in the notes.</p>
