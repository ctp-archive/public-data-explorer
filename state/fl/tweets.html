    <div>
      <p>Let's take a look at California, Florida, and Texas. CA has a lot of cases, but it also has a lot of people and tests. Florida, though it had a larger outbreak earlier, looks much the same. (We only had a FL hospitalization number for a few days.) https://t.co/xVmyOdMLf8</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 13, 2020, 2:55 PM PDT</h2>

    <h2>June 16, 2020, 3:45 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Florida's cases and positive percentage are both rising. That is to say: the rising case load is not <em>just</em> about a greater number of tests. Now would be a good time for the state to do the right thing and put out a reliable number of current hospitalizations. https://t.co/MiRVki0lMv</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 17, 2020, 3:21 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Hospitalizations reflect the same trends. Arizona now has more people hospitalized than NY.</p>

      <p>A common question: are coronavirus cases going up because we're testing so many more people?</p>
<p>A: Certainly not in Florida, where testing slowed down 3% while new cases grew 88% over the last week. https://t.co/F6cxcSiHR5</p>

<p>Missouri’s percent positive rate has gone from 4.3% the week of June 14 to 6.5% this week, with hospitalizations rising. https://t.co/ahvI7Gdn7W</p>

<p>One topline: While Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas are dominating the headlines, many other areas also have serious problems.</p>

    <h2>July 2, 2020, 3:08 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Looking at new cases, the trends of the last couple weeks continue. Florida became the second state to record a day of over 10,000 new cases (after New York on April 15th). Georgia set a new record yesterday and broke it today. https://t.co/77LvPQIhyU</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 2, 2020, 3:13 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>It should be obvious now, but the large numbers of new cases in these states are not just due to testing. Florida and Georgia have positivity rates well beyond 10%.</p>
<p>Only Arizona has a higher positivity rate than Florida right now. https://t.co/ovxcUPtGpp</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 4, 2020, 9:54 AM PDT</h2>
