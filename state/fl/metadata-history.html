    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <div>
      <p>Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data for Florida non-residents in our deaths and hospitalizations figures but not in cases and tests. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html">Per reporting</a>, the number of <strong>pending tests</strong> (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2020, Florida <a href="https://twitter.com/healthyfla/status/1345054200800157699?s=21">announced</a> that they would not be updating their data on January 1, 2021 due to the New Year holiday. We were able to update <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> from Florida's separate <a href="https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/COVIDHospitalizationsCounty?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:embed=y">hospitalization source</a>.</p>
<p>On December 25, 2020, Florida <a href="https://twitter.com/healthyfla/status/1342511673261711360?s=21">announced</a> via the official Florida Department of Health twitter that they would not be updating their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. We were able to update <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> from Florida's separate <a href="https://bi.ahca.myflorida.com/t/ABICC/views/Public/COVIDHospitalizationsCounty?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:embed=y">hospitalization source</a>.</p>
<p>On December 10, 2020,  we cleared <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> from August 12 onward and are reporting them as <strong>Deaths (confirmed and probable)</strong>. On August 11, Florida added antigen tests to its data definition for deaths, which were previously PCR only.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Florida did not update their data, presumably due to the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>On November 3, 2020, Florida’s <strong>Positive PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> dropped by over 200 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the <code>T_NegRes</code> and <code>C_AllResTypes</code> values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong> did not update.</p>
<p>As of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our <strong>Probable cases</strong> field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html">the Florida Department of Health announced</a> that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to &quot;an unforeseen technical issue&quot; that was &quot;not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.&quot; The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.</p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html">announced</a> that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.</p>
<p>On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for <strong>Cases or Confirmed cases</strong> (<code>positiveCasesViral</code> in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> (<code>positive</code> in our API) will be unaffected.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>
<p>As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> data for those patients with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong>, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong>, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does <strong>not</strong> represent the number of specimens.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> metric.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data for Florida non-residents in our deaths and hospitalizations figures but not in cases and tests. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html">Per reporting</a>, the number of <strong>pending tests</strong> (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.</p>
<p>On December 10, 2020,  we cleared <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> from August 12 onward and are reporting them as <strong>Deaths (confirmed and probable)</strong>. On August 11, Florida added antigen tests to its data definition for deaths, which were previously PCR only.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Florida did not update their data, presumably due to the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>On November 3, 2020, Florida’s <strong>Positive PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> dropped by over 200 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the <code>T_NegRes</code> and <code>C_AllResTypes</code> values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong> did not update.</p>
<p>As of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our <strong>Probable cases</strong> field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html">the Florida Department of Health announced</a> that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to &quot;an unforeseen technical issue&quot; that was &quot;not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.&quot; The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.</p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html">announced</a> that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.</p>
<p>On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for <strong>Cases or Confirmed cases</strong> (<code>positiveCasesViral</code> in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> (<code>positive</code> in our API) will be unaffected.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>
<p>As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> data for those patients with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong>, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong>, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does <strong>not</strong> represent the number of specimens.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> metric.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data for Florida non-residents in our deaths and hospitalizations figures but not in cases and tests. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html">Per reporting</a>, the number of <strong>pending tests</strong> (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.</p>
<p>On December 10, 2020,  we cleared <strong>Deaths (confirmed)</strong> from August 12 onward and are reprorting them as <strong>Deaths (confirmed and probable)</strong>. On August 11, Florida added antigen tests to its data definition for deaths, which were previously PCR only.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Florida did not update their data, presumably due to the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>On November 3, 2020, Florida’s <strong>Positive PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> dropped by over 200 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the <code>T_NegRes</code> and <code>C_AllResTypes</code> values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong> did not update.</p>
<p>As of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our <strong>Probable cases</strong> field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html">the Florida Department of Health announced</a> that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to &quot;an unforeseen technical issue&quot; that was &quot;not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.&quot; The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.</p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html">announced</a> that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.</p>
<p>On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for <strong>Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> (<em>positiveCasesViral</em> in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> (<em>positive</em> in our API) will be unaffected.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>
<p>As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> data for those patients with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong>, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong>, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does <strong>not</strong> represent the number of specimens.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> metric.</p>

      <p>Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data for Florida non-residents in our deaths and hospitalizations figures but not in cases and tests. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html">Per reporting</a>, the number of <strong>pending tests</strong> (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.</p>
<p>On November 3, 2020, Florida’s <strong>Positive PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> dropped by over 200 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the <code>T_NegRes</code> and <code>C_AllResTypes</code> values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong> did not update.</p>
<p>As of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our <strong>Probable cases</strong> field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html">the Florida Department of Health announced</a> that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to &quot;an unforeseen technical issue&quot; that was &quot;not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.&quot; The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.</p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html">announced</a> that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.</p>
<p>On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for <strong>Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> (<em>positiveCasesViral</em> in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> (<em>positive</em> in our API) will be unaffected.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>
<p>As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> data for those patients with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong>, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong>, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does <strong>not</strong> represent the number of specimens.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> metric.</p>

As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for <strong>Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> (<em>positiveCasesViral</em> in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> (<em>positive</em> in our API) will be unaffected.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>
<p>As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> data for those patients with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong>, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong>, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does <strong>not</strong> represent the number of specimens.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> metric.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data about Florida non-residents in all metrics where possible. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html">Per reporting</a>, the number of <strong>pending tests</strong> (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.</p>
<p>On October 30, 2020, the number of negative residents ('T_NegRes') remained unchanged on Florida's ArcGIS layer. The number of unique people tested in 'totalTestsPeopleViral' draws from 'T_NegRes' and 'C_AllResTypes' fields on Florida's ArcGIS layer.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2020, Florida started providing a full timeseries of total test encounters excluding tests from individuals after they test positive. We started capturing this data in our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field. As of October 27, 2020, Florida's total test results are also drawn from our <code>totalTestEncountersViral</code> field instead of calculated via the number of unique individuals testing positive and negative. The number of unique people tested, now drawn from the <code>T_NegRes</code> and <code>C_AllResTypes</code> values on Florida's ArcGIS layer, is still available in <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code>. The new encounters time-series only reflects Florida residents, so we have also revised our existing cases figures and unique individuals tested figure to reflect only residents. These changes resulted in a 1.28% decrease in Florida's cases and a 0.38% decrease in Florida's unique people tested.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong> did not update.</p>
<p>As of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our <strong>Probable cases</strong> field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html">the Florida Department of Health announced</a> that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to &quot;an unforeseen technical issue&quot; that was &quot;not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.&quot; The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.</p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html">announced</a> that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.</p>

As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for <strong>Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> (<em>positiveCasesViral</em> in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> (<em>positive</em> in our API) will be unaffected.</p>

      <p>Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data about Florida non-residents in all metrics where possible. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html">Per reporting</a>, the number of <strong>pending tests</strong> (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2020, only some of Florida's data updated by our publication time. Data points such as <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong> did not update.</p>
<p>As of October 13, 2020, Florida's Antigen positive timeseries is stored in our <strong>Probable cases</strong> field, reflecting a response to our outreach to Florida's health department that it switches Antigen positive cases to PCR positive cases in their daily state report upon confirmatory PCR testing.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html">the Florida Department of Health announced</a> that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to &quot;an unforeseen technical issue&quot; that was &quot;not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.&quot; The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.</p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html">announced</a> that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.</p>
<p>On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for <strong>Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> (<em>positiveCasesViral</em> in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> (<em>positive</em> in our API) will be unaffected.</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>
<p>As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> data for those patients with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong>, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong>, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does <strong>not</strong> represent the number of specimens.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> metric.</p>

      <p>Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data about Florida non-residents in all metrics where possible. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> metric.</p>
<p>Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong>, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong>, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does <strong>not</strong> represent the number of specimens.</p>
<p>As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> data for those patients with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4,000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>
<p>On August 14, 2020, Florida began distinguishing between people with positive antigen tests and people with positive PCR tests in the Total Cases number given in their daily state report. As of September 30, 2020, we have removed these antigen positives from the values for <strong>Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> (<em>positiveCasesViral</em> in our API), so the values for this metric in our time series will be lower. <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> (<em>positive</em> in our API) will be unaffected.</p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html">announced</a> that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.</p>
<p>On October 10, 2020, Florida did not report COVID-19 data. The state initially reported that this was because Helix Laboratory, a private lab, submitted 400,000 previously submitted results, which required extra deduplication time. On October 12, 2020, <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/10/101220-1127-covid19.pr.html">the Florida Department of Health announced</a> that the error was not the fault of the private lab, but was due to &quot;an unforeseen technical issue&quot; that was &quot;not the fault of Helix or the Department of Health.&quot; The state's data for October 11, 2020 appears to include data from both October 10 and 11.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html">Per reporting</a>, the number of <strong>pending tests</strong> (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.</p>

      <p>Florida combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard (first noted July 2, 2020). We include data about Florida non-residents in all metrics where possible. For some metrics, we use machine queries against the Florida Department of Health's raw data, which may not be displayed on its <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/96dd742462124fa0b38ddedb9b25e429/">dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>On March 21, 2020, Florida began including tests of people not investigated as PUIs in its <strong>Negative PCR tests</strong> metric.</p>
<p>Since May 15, 2020, Florida reports total tests in unique people and in unique people tested per lab. For that latter number, if an individual is tested twice by one lab, they only get counted once, but if an individual gets tested twice at different labs, they get counted twice. We store the former value in <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong>, and the latter value, which does not match any of our totals units, in <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong>, our specimens field, where we also store testing data with unclear units. This value does <strong>not</strong> represent the number of specimens.</p>
<p>As of July 10, 2020, Florida reports <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> data for those patients with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>On August 12, 2020, the Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, the Florida Department of Health <a href="http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/09/090120-1112-covid19.pr.html">announced</a> that Quest Diagnostics had reported nearly 75,000 backlogged tests dating as far back as April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html">Per reporting</a>, the number of <strong>pending tests</strong> (available in our API and CSVs) may include only results from public labs, and may therefore be an undercount.</p>

      <p>We report using the raw data provided by FDOH but we include both Florida residents and non-residents.</p>
<p>On March 21, negatives jumped due to a methodology change: tests of people not investigated as PUIs are now included.</p>
<p>On March 26, the dashboard stopped including non-residents in its visible counts, but they're still tracked behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Per reporting [https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html], the number of pending tests might be an under-count since it might include only public labs.</p>
<p>As of May 15, Florida is reporting both specimens (PCR and antibody) and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested. However, the &quot;people tested&quot; number reported on Florida's dashboard has come into question as of May 31, because this number is not fully de-duplicated. Florida's report states that: &quot;People tested on multiple days will be included for each day a new result was received.&quot;</p>
<p>As of July 2, Florida is reporting PCR and antigen tests together.</p>
<p>As of July 10, Florida is reporting current hospitalizations as those with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>On August 9, Florida did not update non-resident hospitalizations or deaths on their dashboard or publicly available ArcGIS data by our publication time. We used the data reported on their state report to report the state's data. The state report only includes Florida residents in their data so we carried over yesterday's cumulative number of non-Florida residents (388) who were hospitalized in the state as well as yesterday's number of non-Florida resident deaths (129).</p>
<p>On August 12, Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data from Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>

      <p>We report using the raw data provided by FDOH but we include both Florida residents and non-residents.</p>
<p>On March 21, negatives jumped due to a methodology change: tests of people not investigated as PUIs are now included.</p>
<p>On March 26, the dashboard stopped including non-residents in its visible counts, but they're still tracked behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Per reporting [https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241882491.html], the number of pending tests might be an under-count since it might include only public labs.</p>
<p>As of May 15, Florida is reporting both specimens (PCR and antibody) and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested. However, the &quot;people tested&quot; number reported on Florida's dashboard has come into question as of May 31, because this number is not fully de-duplicated. Florida's report states that: &quot;People tested on multiple days will be included for each day a new result was received.&quot;</p>
<p>As of July 2, Florida is reporting PCR and antigen tests together.</p>
<p>As of July 10, Florida is reporting current hospitalizations as those with a &quot;primary diagnosis of COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>On August 9, Florida did not update non-resident hospitalizations or deaths on their dashboard or publicly available ArcGIS data by our publication time. We used the data reported on their state report to report the state's data. The state report only includes Florida residents in their data so we carried over yesterday's cumulative number of non-Florida residents (388) who were hospitalized in the state as well as yesterday's number of non-Florida resident deaths (129).</p>
<p>On August 12, Florida Department of Health reported via Twitter that it had received a large backlog of testing data frmo Niznik Lab Corp in Miami: &quot;The lab reported over 4000 cases occurring over the last 7 weeks, but which had not been reported to FDOH until today. Therefore, this backlog severely skews today's daily report for Miami-Dade and is not reflective of current trends.&quot;</p>

      <p>3/26 drop in positives due to methology change. Florida has recently changed their accounting and is only reporting residents, apparently based on CDC guidance. Their totals don’t match positives + negatives on their dashboard. We currently only record the positives and negatives until we understand the discrepancy. 3/21 jump in negatives due to change in methodology. Used to only report negatives who were PUIs by state, excluding people tested at commercial/hospital labs and whom the counties never investigated as PUIs.</p>
