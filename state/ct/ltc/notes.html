  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <div>
    <p>In Connecticut, long-term care facilities include Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities. This data is reported on two separate spreadsheets. Connecticut reports cumulative, outbreak and facility-level data for Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities. Connecticut reports staff and resident cases and staff and resident deaths separately. Death data combines confirmed and probable deaths.</p>
<p>Connecticut provides cumulative data for resident and staff cases and resident and staff deaths and number of facilities with a case. To get cumulative resident case totals for Nursing Homes, CTP added together both columns for &quot;Cumulative # residents with confirmed COVID-19.”  To get cumulative resident deaths for Nursing Homes, CTP added together the the two columns for &quot;Cumulative # COVID-related deaths among residents.” To get cumulative resident death totals for Assisted Living facilities, CTP added together both columns for resident deaths.</p>
<p>Connecticut provides outbreak data for resident and staff cases and resident and staff deaths for Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities. Outbreak data is labeled as “new” and includes cases and deaths over the past 7 days.</p>
<h3><strong>Assisted Living Reporting Timeline:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>June 11-18, 2020: CT did not update LTC data.</li>
<li>Before June 17, 2020: Resident cases were reported through CT Department of Public Health. Resident deaths were reported by the CT Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and included confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths. According to the CT DoH, “COVID-19-associated deaths include persons who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of death (laboratory-confirmed) and persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death (probable).&quot; Staff cases and deaths were not reported.</li>
<li>Before July 1, 2020: CT was reporting cumulative assisted living resident cases that were self-reported by Assisted Living Facilities through their Long-Term Care Mutual Aid Plan (LTC-MAP) web-based system, and resident deaths were reported by the CT Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.</li>
<li>July 8, 2020: CT began reporting resident deaths that were self-reported by Assisted Living Facilities through their LTC-MAP system. It includes both confirmed and suspect deaths. Confirmed deaths include those among residents who tested positive for COVID-19. Suspected deaths include those among residents with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, but did not have a laboratory positive COVID-19 test. The LTC-MAP deaths are self-reported by Assisted Living Facilities and are not based upon cause of death as determined by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.</li>
<li>July 9, 2020: CT provided a range of resident cases and deaths and staff cases and deaths from July 1-July 7, which CTP added to previous cumulative totals for July 9th cumulative totals.</li>
<li>July 17, 2020: CT resumed reporting cumulative totals after reassessing their resident death data on July 14.</li>
<li>July 23, 2020: CT’s resumed cumulative reporting of assisted living provided a new set of timeframes of cumulative collected data. Resident deaths are cumulative through July 14. Res cases are through July 21. Staff cumulative is from July 1-July 21.</li>
<li>July 30, 2020: Cumulative resident COVID-19 cases are through July 28. Cumulative resident COVID-19 associated deaths are represented in two columns, one which is data through July 14 reported by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the other is since July 15th reported by LTC-MAP. Due to the differing definitions of COVID-19 associated deaths used by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and LTC-MAP, there is a possibility of duplication of deaths among prior and current resident death data. Staff cumulative cases and deaths are from July 1 to July 28th.</li>
<li>November 26, 2020: CT didn't report LTC data. All data is carried over from the previous week.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Nursing Home Reporting Timeline:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Before June 17, 2020: Resident cases were reported through CT Department of Public Health. Resident deaths were reported by the CT Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and included confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths. According to the CT DPH, “COVID-19-associated deaths include persons who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of death (laboratory-confirmed) and persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death (probable).&quot; Staff cases and deaths were not reported.</li>
<li>June 17, 2020: CT DPH began reporting NHSN data for nursing homes as a weekly outbreak. NSHN data from June 17 to June 23rd was added to the previous cumulative total to reflect CTP’s cumulative data on June 25. Staff cases and deaths were also reported for the first time with NHSN data.</li>
<li>June 22, 2020: All CT NH data from June 18 was carried over to June 22.</li>
<li>June 25, 2020: To get cumulative totals, CTP adds the weekly totals to the previous week’s cumulative data.</li>
<li>July 9, 2020: CT provided a range of resident cases and staff cases / resident cases and deaths and staff cases and deaths from July 1-July 7, which CTP added to cumulative totals for July 9th CTP totals.</li>
<li>July 14, 2020: CT rebaselined their cumulative death data for residents to deduplicate deaths. Since this rebaselining, CT reports deaths as cumulative before July 14th as one total and a second cumulative total beginning on July 14th. Deaths counted before July 14 include both confirmed (laboratory positive for covid) and probable deaths as determined by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Deaths counted after July 14 include both confirmed and suspected deaths as self-reported by nursing homes to NHSN. Suspect deaths are those among residents who passed away that demonstrated signs or symptoms before passing.</li>
<li>July 16, 2020: All CT NH data from July 9th was carried over to July 16.</li>
<li>July 17, 2020: CT reported cumulative totals for resident and staff case and death totals. These new totals are not reflected because they did not coincide with a data collection day.</li>
<li>July 21, 2020: CT reassessed their data and eliminated duplicate resident cases. This resulted in a drop in cases from July 17 to July 23. This drop in cases is not reflected in CTP’s data because July 17 was not captured in our data collection shifts.</li>
<li>July 23, 2020: For nursing homes, CT used two different systems to report staff and residents. All staff are reported via NSHS. Residents are reported by CT Dept Health</li>
<li>July 30, 2020: Cumulative data reported to CT DPH is through July 21st. NHSN data represented data from July 22 to July 28. The two sets of totals were added together for July 30 data collection.</li>
<li>October 29, 2020: CT didn't report LTC data. All data is carried over from the previous week.</li>
<li>November 5, 2020: Assisted living facility cumulative resident deaths decreased by 6.</li>
<li>November 26, 2020: CT didn't report LTC data. All data is carried over from the previous week and outbreak data is removed.</li>
<li>February 11, 2021: CT did not provide Assisted Living or Nursing Home data. Data is carried over from February 4, 2021.</li>
<li>February 18, 2021: Cumulative assisted living resident deaths decreased by one.</li>

  <h3>Facility notes</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The state provides facility-level cumulative data. The state provides facility-level outbreak data. Cumulative facility-level data was first reported by the state on 2020-05-28. Outbreak facility-level data was first reported by the state on 2020-06-18.</p>
<p>Because each state reports facility-level data differently, CTP has produced a number of scripts to make the dataset as standardized and comprehensive as possible. This state uses the following scripts: post_processing, standardize_data. More information on each of these scripts can be found in our Airtable Facility Script Annotations.
