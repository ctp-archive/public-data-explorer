    <div>
      <p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for Connecticut reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized. Connecticut stopped reporting hospital discharges on October 22, 2020, but the time series for the metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads.</p>
<p>As of February 23, 2021, Connecticut's <code>totalTestResults</code> field is taken directly from <code>totalTestsViral</code> instead of calculated from positive + negative. We also cleared the history of Negative (people or cases) since it was calculated using mixed units.</p>
<p>On February 3, 2021, we updated the <strong>Total Antigen Tests</strong> and backfilled <strong>Positive Antigen Tests</strong> and <strong>Negative Antigen Tests</strong> from Connecticut's testing dataset provided by the state. Going forward, we'll be updating all these 3 metrics on weekdays. On February 23, we backfilled <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> from the same source so that it would only include PCR tests. This resulted in a drop at the topline of 345,693 tests, distributed over the timeseries.</p>
<p>On December 25, 2020, Connecticut announced on their <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19-Data-Tracker">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 through December 27, 2020 or on January 1, 2021 due to the holidays.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Connecticut announced via a <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2020/11-2020/Governor-Lamont-Coronavirus-Update-November-25">press release</a> that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020 due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Additionally, the data for November 26, 2020 and November 27, 2020 will both be included in the November 27, 2020 update.</p>
<p>On November 5, 2020, Connecticut announced that a backlog of roughly 500 cases identified in August-November 2020, would be reported in the totals for November 5, 2020.</p>
<p>On June 24, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong> (which can be found in our API and CSVs).</p>
<p>On June 18, 2020, Connecticut corrected some errors in its data, resulting in a decrease in <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On May 29, 2020, Connecticut hospitalization data changed due to reporting laboratory-confirmed cases only. These changes resulted in a decrease in the numbers for <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong> and <strong>Recovered</strong> (which can be found in our API and CSVs).</p>
<p>On May 27, 2020, Connecticut deduplicated some of its data, resulting in a decrease in <strong>Cases</strong> and <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
