    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div>
      West Virginia reports cumulative and outbreak data for long-term care facilities. West Virginia reports staff and resident cases, and combined total for staff and resident deaths. WV provides cumulative counts per facility, and CTP then sums those up to get total cumulative counts. Active and closed outbreaks are listed on West Virginia’s dashboard, but cases and deaths for closed outbreaks are removed from WV’s dashboard if more than 14 days have passed since that facility’s last outbreak. West Virginia defines an outbreak as one lab confirmed case within 14 days, and is active until 14 days after the last confirmed case. West Virginia releases facility-level data. They do not include the facility type. 

June 15-July 9, 2020: West Virginia did not update the Long-Term Care dashboard. 

July 9, 2020:  West Virginia kept all facility totals from the previous month except for one facility - Eldercare Health and Rehabilitation in Jackson County.  On June 15, 2020, this facility reported 71 resident cases, 32 staff cases, 15 total deaths. On July 9, 2020, these cases and deaths were removed and replaced by 1 staff case and the facility was marked as an “active” outbreak. West Virginia defines an active outbreak as “two lab confirmed cases within 14 days of one another, and is active until 14 days after the last confirmed case.”

July 17, 2020: West Virginia carried over all facility totals except for 3 facilities. On July 9, 2020, Eastbrook Center in Kanawha County reported 19 resident cases, 32 staff cases and 15 deaths. On July 17, 2020, all cases and deaths for this facility were removed and replaced with 2 staff cases. On July 9, 2020, Riverside Health and Rehabilitation in Kanawha County reported 29 resident cases, 23 staff cases and 11 deaths. On July 17th, all cases and deaths for this facility were removed except for 3 resident cases and two staff cases. Eldercare Health and Rehabilitation still has only 1 staff case, instead of the deaths and cases mentioned in the July 9, 2020 note above. 

August 13, 2020: West Virginia added previous outbreaks back into the cumulative totals.

November 5, 2020: Cumulative facilities went down from 123 to 106. 

November 12, 2020: West Virginia no longer shares cumulative resident positives, staff positives or deaths. CTP carried previous cumulative totals. The number of reporting facilities dropped by one. Between data collected 11/4 and data collected from 11/5 there were drops in resident cases (drop of 93) and staff cases (drop of 66). The state is now only updating long-term care data on Fridays. 

January 7, 2021: One facility on today’s spreadsheet, Princeton Health Care Center was missing two cells of data that have been there in previous weeks. CTP carried over that data, specifically 54 cumulative resident cases and 45 cumulative staff cases, from last week. We are reaching out to West Virginia about these issues and will update this note as we receive more information.

January 21, 2021: Carried values for Cumulative Resident Cases and Cumulative Staff Cases from December 30, 2020 for Princeton Health Care Center due to inconsistencies in reporting. We are reaching out to the state for more information.

      West Virginia reports cumulative and outbreak data for long-term care facilities. West Virginia reports staff and resident cases, and combined total for staff and resident deaths. Cumulative data is calculated by CTP by lining up historical facility-level data, removing any duplicate cases and deaths and totaling.  Active and closed outbreaks are listed on West Virginia’s dashboard, but cases and deaths for closed outbreaks are removed from WV’s dashboard if more than 14 days have passed since that facility’s last outbreak.
