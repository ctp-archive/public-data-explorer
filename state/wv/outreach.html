    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We have two questions about the information West Virginia shares with the CDC regarding COVID-19.</p>
<ol>
<li>In looking at the CDC’s Cases and Deaths dataset (United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time. link: https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36) we notice that West Virginia has values reported for new probable deaths (‘pnew_death’) however no value is reported for probable deaths (‘probdeath’). For example, on 2/11, the value for ‘pnew_death’ was 6 while the field for ‘probdeath’ was blank.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you confirm that West Virginia is reporting probable deaths information to the CDC? And, can you confirm the most up-to-date information you have regarding probable deaths over time?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>More generally, can you tell us about the different mechanisms of reporting cases and deaths to the federal government (voluntary NNDS, aggregate counts process, and line level reporting from the state health department)? We are particularly interested in the aggregate count process as it appears to be the source of the state-level data published by the federal government regularly.</li>
</ol>

        <div>
          <p>West Virginia reports aggregate case and death counts (both probable and confirmed) to CDC each day through their aggregate count reporting mechanism. Initially when CDC set up that reporting system, we did not give them permission to publish and publicly report our death total segregated into confirmed and probable counts because at the time we were not doing so on our own public dashboard. We assume that is why the probable death totals are not reported on their site. We do report both probable and confirmed death counts to CDC each day and on our public dashboard. We plan to contact CDC to grant them permission to report our probable death counts on their site.</p>
<p>Please note that our dashboard is always the most reliable source of information for West Virginia’s data.</p>

When reporting testing results, if the same person gets different test results on different days, would you report raw results as part of the daily positives or do you apply any kind of logic such as reporting only the first negative or positive result per individual?</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We’re interested in testing data in units of “testing encounters”, which can be defined as “the number of unique people who have been tested per day.” Under this metric, if a person is being tested once today and once again the following week, that counts as two tests, however, if the same person has two samples tested at a testing center visit, then that only counts as one testing encounter. Are you willing to or are you planning to release testing encounters? If so, will you be able to provide historical data consistently in an automation friendly form, like an ArcGIS or CKAN API or a direct download of CSV or JSON?</p>

          <p>Is it possible that that data is for the “check all that apply?” I’ll be honest, I didn’t know it was doing that. I believe that may include unknown. Because when you look at the data table that’s creating that graph, it actually lists, white, AIAN, they’re listed separately but has zero and then a case count for Black. Now that I see that, I feel certain that Unknown is included in that and I’ll see if we can get that changed because that shouldn’t be that way. I’ll have to check and see if that’s for the data beyond the 7-day trends. Let me get some more information on that. There are several categories where we have data on our laboratory reports as incomplete. We’re hopeful that federal requirements for complete data being submitted to us on the laboratory reports will continue to improve. We’ve got a pretty significant team working with reporting facilities across the state to address some of the areas w/ incomplete data and this is one of the areas where we have difficulty getting it from the laboratory reports and also have difficulty collecting this information in case interviews.</p>

          <p>Two of the reasons might be because the laboratory report does not contain the information. And the other is that the case interview does not disclose or is unable to be reached.</p>

          <p>They are not currently reported on the website. It is in our plans to report them in the future. I can’t speak to that at this time. (CTP: When you do, will you report them separately?)
