    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div>
      Mississippi reports long-term care data for Nursing Homes, Personal Care Homes, Assisted Living Homes, and Intermediate Care Facilities. Mississippi reports both cumulative and current outbreak data. Mississippi’s cumulative data starts April 2020, and it records resident cases and deaths, and number of facilities. Mississippi only report outbreak facility-level data. 

Mississippi’s outbreak data is self-reported by facilities. The state defines active outbreaks as facilities that have reported one current COVID-19 case. For outbreak data, Mississippi separates facility by Nursing Homes, Personal Care Homes and Intermediate Care Facilities. CTP records Personal Care Homes in the Other category and does not include Intermediate Care Facilities data. Mississippi defines an outbreak as one or more cases among long-term care facility residents or 2 or more cases among staff within a 14 day period. 

June 4, 2020: Mississippi began releasing active outbreak data.

June 25, 2020: Mississippi stopped breaking out Assisted Living by facility-type this week. 

July 2, 2020: Outbreak data was not updated by Mississippi. 

July 9, 2020: Outbreak data was not updated by Mississippi. 

October 8, 2020: Mississippi stopped reporting facility-level data. The state reported, &quot;Because nursing homes report COVID-19 data directly to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), we have replaced our usual long-term care facility report with the most recent CMS nursing home data, avoiding duplicate reporting requirements for these facilities. CMS data does not include state-regulated facilities such as Assisted Living facilities, which were included in Mississippi&#39;s previous long-term care facility report. CTP is reporting the cumulative sum totals that Mississippi reports on the state site. (CTP is not carrying forward previously reported data for state-regulated facilities because it would conflict with the state&#39;s current reporting.)

January 7, 2021: Mississippi&#39;s website is down. Data from December 29, 2020 is carried over.

October 8, 2020: Mississippi stopped reporting facility-level data. The state reported, &quot;Because nursing homes report COVID-19 data directly to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), we have replaced our usual long-term care facility report with the most recent CMS nursing home data, avoiding duplicate reporting requirements for these facilities.&quot; CMS data does not include state-regulated facilities such as Assisted Living facilities, which were included in Mississippi&#39;s previous long-term care facility report. CTP is reporting the cumulative sum totals that Mississippi reports on the state site. (CTP is not carrying forward previously reported data for state-regulated facilities because it would conflict wtih the state&#39;s current reporting.)

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div>
      Mississippi reports long-term care data for Nursing Homes, Personal Care Homes, Assisted Living Homes, and Intermediate Care Facilities. Mississippi reports both cumulative and current outbreak data. Mississippi’s cumulative data starts April 2020, and it records resident cases and deaths, and number of facilities. Facility type is not reported in cumulative data.

Mississippi’s outbreak data is self-reported by facilities. The state defines active outbreaks as facilities that have reported one current COVID-19 case. For outbreak data, Mississippi separates facility by Nursing Homes, Personal Care Homes and Intermediate Care Facilities. CTP records Personal Care Homes in the Other category and does not include Intermediate Care Facilities data. Mississippi defines an outbreak as one or more cases among long-term care facility residents or 2 or more cases among staff within a 14 day period. 

June 4, 2020: Mississippi began releasing active outbreak data.
June 25, 2020: Mississippi stopped breaking out Assisted Living by facility-type this week. 
July 2, 2020: Outbreak data was not updated by Mississippi. 
July 9, 2020: Outbreak data was not updated by Mississippi.
