      <p>Mississippi started updating testing totals on a weekly schedule on September, 27, 2020, so each update includes many days worth of testing.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>From May 21, 2020 through May 26, 2020, we briefly captured Mississippi's Positive antibody tests (specimens) through state press conferences. As of May 26, 2020, Mississippi no longer reports this metric. On February 11, 2021, we cleared Mississippi's Positive antibody tests (specimens) timeseries to ensure that our data is as accurate and consistent as possible.</p>
<p>On October 25, 2020, Mississippi announced that COVID-19 data for October 24, 2020 and October 25, 2020 would be published on Monday. As a result, Mississippi did not update on October 24, 2020 and October 25, 2020.</p>
<p>On September 15, 2020, Mississippi resumed reporting current hospitalizations, ICU, and ventilations on the source we have historically used for this metric. We are working to backfill these data points in our historical data.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2020, we discovered a new source for Mississippi current hospitalizations and current ICU admissions on the Mississippi State Department of Health website.</p>
<p>Between June 17 and June 22, 2020, Mississippi experienced technical difficulties with their reporting system. We filled in five days of <strong>case</strong> and <strong>death</strong> data on June 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On May 26, 2020, news reports indicated that 95 antibody tests had returned positive in Mississippi, but we have not found more recent data since then for this metric.</p>
<p>As of May 23, 2020, Mississippi is separating out PCR and antibody tests. We now report both separately.</p>

      <p>As of May 23, 2020, Mississippi is separating out PCR and antibody tests. We now report both separately.</p>
<p>Between June 17 and June 22, 2020, Mississippi experienced technical difficulties with their reporting system. We filled in five days of <strong>case</strong> and <strong>death</strong> data on June 22, 2020.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2020, we discovered a new source for Mississippi current hospitalizations and current ICU admissions on the Mississippi State Department of Health website.</p>
<p>On September 15, 2020, Mississippi resumed reporting current hospitalizations, ICU, and ventilations on the source we have historically used for this metric. We are working to backfill these data points in our historical data.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>

      <p>Negatives = Total - Positives.
Hospitalizations are calculated by calculating multiplying % of hospitalized times total cases, pending clarification from the state. Recoveries are estimated, and updated twice weekly. As of April 27, Mississippi is reporting people tested.
As of 5/23, MS started separating out PCR and antibody tests. Total tests might be impacted</p>

    <div>
      <p>Negatives are calculated from total positives (public and commercial labs) and total tests (state lab only), therefore they should be treated as a lower bound for actual negatives. We've seen Mississippi update positives without updating totals, in which case we keep the last inferred negative count, rather than recalculating and reducing the negative count. The update time we use is the &quot;as of&quot; time listed in the map/charts, not the &quot;page updated&quot; time at the top.</p>
