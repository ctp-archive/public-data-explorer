    <div>
      <p>What a solid update by @HealthyFla to their COVID-19 data reporting. Thank you.</p>
<p>https://t.co/Oleet5NkWk https://t.co/ucfnXpdBS4</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 27, 2020, 10:06 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Some open questions: when a state says &quot;hospitalized,&quot; does that mean currently or cumulatively? What does recovered mean and how is that tracked? Some states are showing ICU numbers, but it's not clear if they are COVID related. It's gonna be tough to nail all this down.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 1, 2020, 2:46 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Illinois showed a sharp increase in COVID-19 deaths today. The state now has 6,980 confirmed cases and 141 cumulative deaths. https://t.co/WSKWzX1IQ6</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 1, 2020, 11:34 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>One crucial addendum to this piece by @DrIbram: the most important piece of missing data would be breakouts by race for COVID-19 deaths, not just cases.</p>
<p>Not a single state reports that yet.</p>
<p>https://t.co/aMJ53mcln1</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 2, 2020, 9:42 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>There's also intense competition for samples from confirmed COVID-19 cases so that new vendors can validate their tests.</p>
<p>We need a nationwide clearinghouse for samples and tests.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 6, 2020, 2:55 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Some unexpected numbers came from Indiana today. Despite only having ~5000 confirmed cases, the state said today it has 924 COVID patients in the ICU and 500 on ventilators. That's not too far from California's ICU count and closing in on Pennsylvania and Louisiana's vent usage.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 6, 2020, 3:15 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The nation passed 10,000 deaths today.</p>
<p>New York stands at 4,758 deaths.  New Jersey passed 1,000.</p>
<p>16 states have lost more than 100 people to COVID-19.</p>

      <p>As of today, 8 states are reporting racial demographics for COVID cases:
CT, IL, MI, MN, NC, NJ, SC, VA</p>
<p>And 5 states are reporting racial demographics for COVID deaths:

      <p>Illinois put out important new data today: confirmed and suspected current COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and ventilator usage. They are big numbers, comparable to California (which reports slightly differently). https://t.co/Bfn6cDv3qL</p>

      <p>This is just another indication that COVID-19, while it broke out on the east and west coasts, will not remain a coastal phenomenon, as Michigan, Louisiana, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, and other states experience intense outbreaks.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 7, 2020, 3:23 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>One thing to note about hospitalization data: New Jersey, Illinois, and California are all including  different sets of people in their numbers. We are reporting the <em>lower</em> numbers where they are available (as in CA, which breaks out confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases).</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 9, 2020, 2:57 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Total deaths reached 16,399.</p>
<p>States reported 1,904 COVID-19 deaths today, about the same level as the past two days. https://t.co/xiwdUw42BF</p>

    <h2>April 10, 2020, 2:33 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>New York continues to dominate the numbers, as you can see in these tiny charts of COVID-19 deaths in hard-hit states. https://t.co/79VARUjNxE</p>

    <h2>April 10, 2020, 2:38 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>Here's the comparison between New York and the rest of the states and territories.</p>
<p>43% of the known lives lost due to COVID-19 have come in New York. https://t.co/cf4tTXbd4Y</p>

      <p>Known COVID-19 deaths also remained near the level they've been at for the past week. https://t.co/Mf5aQmV0Tj</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 12, 2020, 8:59 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>So, yesterday, we made the tough decision to begin to standardize the way we capture state data to sum testing-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and suspected cases in our &quot;currently hospitalized&quot; numbers.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 12, 2020, 8:59 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>This is not an across-the-board methodological change. For cases, like Wyoming, where the state reports confirmed and suspected ~cases~ of COVID-19, we will report only the &quot;confirmed&quot; in our case count. This is just about current hospitalizations.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 15, 2020, 9:35 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We have an announcement. We’re joining up with our @TheAtlantic colleague @DrIbram and his @AntiracismCtr to begin tracking racial data about COVID-19 in the US. https://t.co/EaCC48mrQh</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 15, 2020, 9:35 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>In the next couple weeks, we will have a dedicated page, the COVID Racial Data Tracker, that will allow anyone to explore these dynamics of the outbreak, using both the data we collect and other datasets that enrich our understanding of the disparities that we’re seeing.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 15, 2020, 9:35 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We’ll also continue to do our own analyses and publish them in ongoing coverage @TheAtlantic. One early example was Vann Newkirk's look at COVID-19's threat to the south: https://t.co/tjsinZqc9U</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 20, 2020, 10:53 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@rosnovsky @cdc The main discrepancy is in how New York City and New York State are reporting presumed COVID deaths. Both methods are defensible, just different. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 21, 2020, 2:21 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Unlike previous highs, this spike was <em>not</em> driven by New York data, but the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Note, too, this data does not include <em>presumptive</em> deaths from COVID in New York City (as the state has not provided that number yet). https://t.co/25cQIoGCkY</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 22, 2020, 2:46 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>However, when comparing COVID-19 deaths to flu deaths, it's important to make sure the comparison is rigorous.</p>

      <p>States reported 1,772 new COVID-19 deaths today, and you can see a familiar falling curve in the reported death data over the week.</p>
<p>The outbreak in New York again made up less than a quarter of US deaths for the day, down from a high of around 50% of the US daily deaths. https://t.co/cdi93XJtHK</p>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong></em> New York City is reporting 4,453 more confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths than the state government is for the city.</p>
<p>If you add those deaths into our dataset, our count (52k) falls between the CDC and JHU. https://t.co/dznPM4bhln</p>

<p>And given how long COVID-19 takes to kill people, these low death numbers are probably a reflection of the infections that occurred 3-4-5 weeks ago (i.e. mid-to-late April).</p>

      <p>Until every state reports this most basic COVID-19 data in the same way, direct test positivity comparisons across states will remain an intractable problem. For that reason—because test positivity rates cannot easily be standardized—we do not currently publish them.</p>

      <p>Health data pipelines in the US are siloed, with each state running its own pipelines to collect data on COVID-19’s spread. In the absence of federal guidelines, and constrained by technical limitations of their systems, many of them use different data definitions.</p>

    <h2>March 5, 2021, 1:56 PM PST</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Definitions are often relegated to small footnotes on state dashboards. But they make a big difference in the data: They can tip the scale between labeling a COVID-19 case as active versus recovered, or between counting or not counting some COVID-19 cases and deaths at all.</p>
