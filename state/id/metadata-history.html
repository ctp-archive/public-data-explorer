On February 13, 2021, the District of Columbia reported 426,830 **Total Test Encounters**, which is a decrease of 751 from the figure reported for the previous day. No explanation was available for this decrease.

On February 12, 2021, the District of Columbia announced that their testing data for the day would be delayed. As a result, we were unable to update their Total PCR tests (test encounters) or Total PCR tests (people).

On December 25, 2020, the District of Columbia announced on their [COVID-19 page](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/data) that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data reported on December 26, 2020 will include numbers from December 24, 2020 and the data reported on December 27, 2020 will include numbers from December 25, 2020 and December 26, 2020.

As of September 18, 2020, District of Columbia&#39;s total test results are drawn from our total`TestEncountersViral` field instead of calculated via positive+negative.

On May 25, 2020, the District of Columbia decreased the district&#39;s **total tests** number by 11,000 to reflect only DC residents.On February 12, 2021, the District of Columbia announced that their testing data for the day would be delayed.

      <p>Idaho's data is on a 1 day lag in our timeseries due to consistently updating after 7:30 pm Eastern Time, when we publish our daily update.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>On January 20, 2021, Idaho <a href="https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1352057437608583168">announced</a> that two deaths had been removed from their total after updated records indicated that they were not due to COVID-19. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag due to late updates, this affects our Deaths (confirmed + probable) and Deaths (confirmed) for January 21, 2021</p>
<p>On January 18, 2021, Idaho <a href="https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1351318456206032903">announced</a> via the official Idaho Department of Health and Welfare twitter that there would be no update to their data due to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data published on January 19, 2021 would include two days of data. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our timeseries this affects our data for January 19, 2021 and January 20, 2021.</p>
<p>On January 12, 2021, Idaho reported 10 cumulative probable deaths on their dashboard,  a decrease from the 179 probable deaths reported the day before. We suspect that this is an error, and in order to ensure that our data is as accurate as possible, we carried over the existing value for Probable deaths on January 12, 2021.</p>
<p>On December 25, 2020, Idaho <a href="https://twitter.com/IDHW">announced</a> via the official Idaho Department of Health and Welfare twitter that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. On December 31, 2020, they <a href="https://twitter.com/IDHW/status/1344793943876145152">noted</a> that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021. Because Idaho's data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we were unable to update their data on December 26, 2020 and January 2, 2021.</p>
<p>On December 9, 2020, Idaho's <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong> dropped from 492,265 from 494,914 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Idaho announced that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our historical data due to consistently updating after we publish our daily update, we will be unable to update their data on November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>As of September 18, 2020, Idaho's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On August 4, 2020, after another period of missing data for <strong>Hospitalized now</strong>, Idaho reported current hospitalizations of 106, down from the previous report of 223 on July 31. It reported a similar drop in ICU patients from 51 on July 31 to 22 on August 4.</p>
<p>On July 22, 2020, Idaho reported 126 total <strong>deaths</strong> but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths, for a calculated total of 136 deaths. We treated the 33 probable deaths data point as an error and reported 126 total deaths for this date, including 103 confirmed and 23 probable deaths. See Idaho state page screenshots for July 22.</p>
<p>From July 13 through July 21, 2020, Idaho was unable to report <strong>Hospitalized now</strong> data due to HHS regulation changes. Idaho retroactively made figures available for these days on July 21, 2020, and we revised our figures to match.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2020, Idaho revised its historical numbers for <strong>Hospitalized now</strong>. We updated our hospitalization figures for Idaho from March 23 to July 13, 2020 to match on July 17, 2020.</p>
<p>On July 3, 2020, Idaho revised down their <strong>Recovered</strong> data by about 1,500, noting that &quot;an error in auto-calculation was discovered.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 5, 2020, Idaho reported a large batch of previously unreported tests. The state's <strong>Total tests</strong> number rose by approximately 2,500 more tests on June 5 than the seven-day average for new tests at that time.</p>
<p>As of April 9, 2020, Idaho reports <strong>probable and confirmed cases</strong> separately.</p>

      <p>Idaho's data is on a 1 day lag in our timeseries due to consistently updating after 7:30 pm Eastern Time, when we publish our daily update.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>On December 25, 2020, Idaho <a href="https://twitter.com/IDHW">announced</a> via the official Idaho Department of Health and Welfare twitter that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. Because Idaho's data is on a one day lag in our timeseries, we were unable to update their data on December 26, 2020.</p>
<p>On December 9, 2020, Idaho's <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong> dropped from 492,265 from 494,914 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Idaho announced that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our historical data due to consistently updating after we publish our daily update, we will be unable to update their data on November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>As of September 18, 2020, Idaho's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On August 4, 2020, after another period of missing data for <strong>Hospitalized now</strong>, Idaho reported current hospitalizations of 106, down from the previous report of 223 on July 31. It reported a similar drop in ICU patients from 51 on July 31 to 22 on August 4.</p>
<p>On July 22, 2020, Idaho reported 126 total <strong>deaths</strong> but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths, for a calculated total of 136 deaths. We treated the 33 probable deaths data point as an error and reported 126 total deaths for this date, including 103 confirmed and 23 probable deaths. See Idaho state page screenshots for July 22.</p>
<p>From July 13 through July 21, 2020, Idaho was unable to report <strong>Hospitalized now</strong> data due to HHS regulation changes. Idaho retroactively made figures available for these days on July 21, 2020, and we revised our figures to match.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2020, Idaho revised its historical numbers for <strong>Hospitalized now</strong>. We updated our hospitalization figures for Idaho from March 23 to July 13, 2020 to match on July 17, 2020.</p>
<p>On July 3, 2020, Idaho revised down their <strong>Recovered</strong> data by about 1,500, noting that &quot;an error in auto-calculation was discovered.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 5, 2020, Idaho reported a large batch of previously unreported tests. The state's <strong>Total tests</strong> number rose by approximately 2,500 more tests on June 5 than the seven-day average for new tests at that time.</p>
<p>As of April 9, 2020, Idaho reports <strong>probable and confirmed cases</strong> separately.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Idaho's data is on a 1 day lag in our timeseries due to consistently updating after 7:30 pm Eastern Time, when we publish our daily update.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>As of September 18, 2020, Idaho's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Idaho announced on their <a href="https://coronavirus.idaho.gov">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020. Because Idaho’s data is on a one day lag in our historical data due to consistently updating after we publish our daily update, we will be unable to update their data on November 27, 2020.</p>
<p>On August 4, 2020, after another period of missing data for <strong>Hospitalized now</strong>, Idaho reported current hospitalizations of 106, down from the previous report of 223 on July 31. It reported a similar drop in ICU patients from 51 on July 31 to 22 on August 4.</p>
<p>On July 22, 2020, Idaho reported 126 total <strong>deaths</strong> but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths, for a calculated total of 136 deaths. We treated the 33 probable deaths data point as an error and reported 126 total deaths for this date, including 103 confirmed and 23 probable deaths. See Idaho state page screenshots for July 22.</p>
<p>From July 13 through July 21, 2020, Idaho was unable to report <strong>Hospitalized now</strong> data due to HHS regulation changes. Idaho retroactively made figures available for these days on July 21, 2020, and we revised our figures to match.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2020, Idaho revised its historical numers for <strong>Hospitalized now</strong>. We updated our hospitalization figures for Idaho from March 23 to July 13, 2020 to match on July 17, 2020.</p>
<p>On July 3, 2020, Idaho revised down their <strong>Recovered</strong> data by about 1,500, noting that &quot;an error in auto-calculation was discovered.&quot;</p>
<p>On June 5, 2020, Idaho reported a large batch of previously unreported tests. The state's <strong>Total tests</strong> number rose by approximately 2,500 more tests on June 5 than the seven-day average for new tests at that time.</p>
<p>As of April 9, 2020, Idaho reports <strong>probable and confirmed cases</strong> separately.</p>

      <p>As of April 9, 2020, Idaho reports <strong>probable and confirmed cases</strong> separately.</p>
<p>On June 5, 2020, Idaho reported a large batch of previously unreported tests. The state's <strong>Total tests</strong> number rose by approximately 2,500 more tests on June 5 than the seven-day average for new tests at that time.</p>
<p>On July 3, 2020, Idaho revised down their <strong>Recovered</strong> data by about 1,500, noting that &quot;an error in auto-calculation was discovered.&quot;</p>
<p>On July 8, 2020, Idaho revised its historical numers for <strong>Hospitalized now</strong>. We updated our hospitalization figures for Idaho from March 23 to July 13, 2020 to match on July 17, 2020.</p>
<p>From July 13 through July 21, 2020, Idaho was unable to report <strong>Hospitalized now</strong> data due to HHS regulation changes. Idaho retroactively made figures available for these days on July 21, 2020, and we revised our figures to match.</p>
<p>On July 22, 2020, Idaho reported 126 total <strong>deaths</strong> but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths, for a calculated total of 136 deaths. We treated the 33 probable deaths data point as an error and reported 126 total deaths for this date, including 103 confirmed and 23 probable deaths. See Idaho state page screenshots for July 22.</p>
<p>On August 4, 2020, after another period of missing data for <strong>Hospitalized now</strong>, Idaho reported current hospitalizations of 106, down from the previous report of 223 on July 31. It reported a similar drop in ICU patients from 51 on July 31 to 22 on August 4.</p>
<p>As of September 18, 2020, Idaho's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>

Total includes Oregon residents tested in Idaho.</p>
<p>As of April 9, Idaho separately reports both probable and confirmed cases. Idaho reports test counts in specimens.</p>
<p>On June 5, Idaho received a large batch of previously unreported tests.</p>
<p>On July 3, ID revised down the Recovered number by about 1,500 noting that &quot;an error in auto-calculation was discovered.&quot;</p>
<p>On July 8, ID revised historical hospitalization, on July 17 we updated those values for March 23 - July 15, carrying forward current values until information is updated.</p>
<p>On July 22, ID reported 126 total deaths but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths. We believe that the correct number of probable deaths is 23 and that 33 was a mistake. We therefore report 126 total deaths in ID for this date. See ID state page screenshots for July 22.</p>
<p>On August 4, Idaho reported current hospitalizations of 106, down from the previous report of 223 on July 31.  It reported a similar drop in ICU patients from  51 on July 31 to 22 on August 4.</p>

<p>On June 5, Idaho received a large batch of previously unreported tests.</p>
<p>On July 3, ID revised down the Recovered number by about 1,500 noting that &quot;an error in auto-calculation was discovered.&quot;</p>
<p>On July 8, ID revised historical hospitalization, on July 17 we updated those values for March 23 - July 15, carrying forward current values until information is updated.</p>
<p>On July 22, ID reported 126 total deaths but also reported 103 lab-confirmed deaths and 33 probable deaths. We believe that the correct number of probable deaths is 23 and that 33 was a mistake. We therefore report 126 total deaths in ID for this date. See ID state page screenshots for July 22.</p>
