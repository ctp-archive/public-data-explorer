      <p>Before our update, we wanted to show you why we do this.
Tracking testing data in the U.S. has been a challenge. The CDC is currently publishing incomplete data that lags several days behind state reports. We collect and clean the state data. Here’s how the two datasets differ: https://t.co/Eu8pbiZ5Rf</p>

<p>He gave a total test number of 313,000 (we show 294k, for a 94% capture rate).</p>

      <p>There is a known difference between what states report and what the CDC says it is reporting. Some states report &quot;people tested&quot; while the CDC reports &quot;specimens tested.&quot;</p>

      <p>The CDC currently reports 99,031 deaths.</p>
<p>In general, the discrepancies in death counts between different sources are small and explicable.</p>
<p>The death toll stands at roughly 100,000 people today.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 18, 2020, 2:19 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>For one thing, only half of states report them despite direction to do so from the CDC. Also, although probables currently account for less than 1% of the nat'l total, they make up 8-20% in the states with the highest proportion of probables, and 75% of all cases in Puerto Rico.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 18, 2020, 2:21 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The variation between states/territories is also fascinating. DC told the Washington Post it doesn't report probables because it doesn't have any. Delaware, meanwhile, with a comparable total case count, reports nearly 1,000 probable cases.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 20, 2020, 3:47 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>States reported 630 deaths. We are still seeing a solid national decline.</p>
<p>Death reporting lags approximately 28 days from symptom onset, according to CDC models that consider lags in symptoms, time in hospital, and the death reporting process. https://t.co/LBmcot3h9a</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 9, 2020, 3:48 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>While doing the research for this change, we learned more about the two different ways states determine COVID-19 deaths. Both have merits: one is a little more accurate, the other is a lot faster. CDC advises one, but uses both. States are in a bind.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 10, 2020, 2:59 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>For the record, we compile current hospitalizations for 48 states and DC now. There are variations in how states count their COVID-19 patients. Because these numbers measure strain on the hospital system, we record both confirmed and suspected COVID-19 hospitalizations.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 23, 2020, 3:09 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Here’s what’s going on. As states switch from the long-established CDC system to the new HHS one, some hospitals appear to be having trouble reporting their numbers. That led both Texas and California to place advisories on their dashboards. https://t.co/fbq1Su5Nz2</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 25, 2020, 3:49 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>But here’s some great news about hospitalization data: We now have figures for current COVID-19 hospitalizations for 50 states and DC  + Guam and Puerto Rico. Once the data settles down from the systems changeover, this should be a very solid national number.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 26, 2020, 2:57 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Hospitalizations fell a bit again. CA and TX (and maybe other states) are still not getting complete data due to the HHS changeover. We’ve frozen the CA and TX figures for now — and will reevaluate tomorrow. We’re hoping the CDC-HHS changeover issues get cleared up this week.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>August 7, 2020, 3:51 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We recorded a considerable drop in hospitalizations today. The new HHS hospitalization dataset had been tracking much higher than our numbers; today, it experienced a precipitous and unrealistic decline. Short story: The data remains mushy since the CDC--&gt;HHS changeover. https://t.co/907rNsK96h</p>

      <p>Update for our data users - we continued to implement changes to our original totalTestResults API field, resulting in a ~600k cumulative test increase since March.</p>
<p>We updated test totals for 14 states: AK, AL, AR, AS, CA, DC, GA, ID, KY, MN, NH, SD, VA, and WA.</p>

      <p>Not only are the units confusing, the formulas for calculating test positivity also vary. We did the math for five states using three methods validated by the CDC and the results are wildly divergent. https://t.co/QbAqz0TybN</p>
