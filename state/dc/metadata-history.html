    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <div>
      <p>On February 16, 2021, the District of Columbia announced that their testing data for the day would be delayed. As a result, we were unable to update their Total PCR tests (test encounters) or Total PCR tests (people).</p>
<p>On February 14, 2021, the District of Columbia’s Total PCR Tests (people), dropped by 1,987 from 426,830 to 424,843 without explanation.</p>
<p>On February 13, 2021, the District of Columbia's Total PCR tests (people) decreased by 751 without explanation.</p>
<p>On December 25, 2020, the District of Columbia announced on their <a href="https://coronavirus.dc.gov/data">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the Christmas holiday. Additionally, they noted that the data reported on December 26, 2020 will include numbers from December 24, 2020 and the data reported on December 27, 2020 will include numbers from December 25, 2020 and December 26, 2020.</p>
<p>As of September 18, 2020, District of Columbia's total test results are drawn from our total<code>TestEncountersViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>As of August 29, 2020, we store the “total overall tested” timeseries in our <strong>Total Test Encounters (PCR)</strong> field despite the following: According to our outreach, the District of Columbia’s “total overall tested” figure on its dashboard represents test encounters, the number of unique individuals tested per day, with one exception, if an individual receives a positive and a negative test on the same day, they are counted twice rather than once.</p>

<p>According to our outreach, the District of Columbia’s “total overall tested” figure on its dashboard represents test encounters, the number of unique individuals tested per day, with one exception: if an individual receives a positive and a negative test on the same day, they are counted twice rather than once.
