      <p>On Michigan. The state has the third-most confirmed cases and deaths (after NY, then NJ). We had not been including their negative test number because the state said it represented &quot;specimens&quot; not people.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 5, 2020, 2:36 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Today, we decided to begin using the state's number. This came after a long debate on whether we could/should calculate a more realistic number. Ultimately, we decided to use Michigan's number straight, as it would be easier for future analysts to adjust from the raw number.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 5, 2020, 2:36 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>But unlike our other numbers, which can be considered &quot;lower bounds&quot; for the number of people tested, we cannot say that about Michigan's number of negative test results.</p>

      <p>A couple of states in the midwest changed the way they report and affected the topline numbers.</p>
<p>Minnesota changed to reporting total tests, not people tested. That led to a jump in our data of 45k+ tests.</p>
<p>Michigan added probable cases to their total, adding 5k cases.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 5, 2020, 3:26 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>The Michigan change is important context for today's number of new cases, which is 28,615, the biggest number since 5/2.</p>
<p>However, without Michigan, there would still be 23k+ new cases today. https://t.co/nSoMRl6pHv</p>

    <h2>June 12, 2020, 3:34 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>One note: Michigan began included probable cases last week. The way we initially recorded that data made it seem as if the state had a spike. MI officials were able to supply us with historical data breaking out probables — and we corrected our numbers to reflect the state's.</p>

      <p>At publish time, we had no updates from 7 of the 56 states and territories we track: AR, CT, KS, MI, MP, RI, and WA. Seven additional states did not report current hospitalizations today: HI, MN, MS, NV, OK, OR, and WI.</p>

      <p>For our API users: Yesterday, we switched totalTestResults to use values from totalTestsViral instead of being calculated from positive+negative in 4 states: IL, ME, MI, and SD.</p>

      <p>These switches caused the totalTestResults field to increase by ~325k (cumulatively). The increases were driven by MI and SD, because our old totalTestResults counted MI positives and SD positives and negatives in units of unique people instead of specimens.</p>
