      <p>New  update with state data up to midnight eastern: tally shows over 4000 tests.</p>
<p>https://t.co/Zc39AZVRge</p>
<p>WA and CA have conducted the most tests and have the most cases. Big gaps in our testing capacity knowledge: MA, TX, GA, PA.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 11, 2020, 1:22 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We await updates from Massachusetts and California, which will also have large numbers. Colorado's numbers are also climbing, standing at 28 cases as of their last update.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 12, 2020, 12:51 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>As we close up the shop for the night, we've been able to track just under 8000 people tested for #COVID19. That's not a lot, and just a few thousand tests got reported today.</p>
<p>We're missing fresh total test numbers from some big states: CA, NY, and MA.</p>
<p>https://t.co/iERV2wLMmu https://t.co/dsb0GejjeI</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 12, 2020, 1:27 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Two exceptions: California and New York. We know our numbers are low there by hundreds, maybe (maybe!) thousands. But it seems highly unlikely to change the <em>overall</em> picture here.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 13, 2020, 1:54 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>These numbers are a lower bound for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are still waiting on accurate negative test counts from CA, MA, GA, and TX, among other states.</li>
<li>Commercial labs only report positive results to the states.</li>
</ol>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 13, 2020, 11:33 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Closing up the shop for the night. We're showing 19,066 tests. 2,182 positives. Here are the four states with the largest known outbreaks: WA, NY, CA, MA. https://t.co/LrCchHRS3V</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 14, 2020, 1:50 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@joshtpm Washington and New York are driving the numbers. We're falling further behind on CA testing numbers. Now that MA is out in the open, the other big question mark is TX.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 16, 2020, 12:19 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Big end of night update. @GavinNewsom put out a new number for California testing (8300 total), which really boosted things.</p>
<p>We're seeing 38,631 people tested, up more than 10k since our 4pm ET update.</p>
<p>CA and WA combined have now done ~48% of testing in our data. https://t.co/LSjuCN2vQg</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 16, 2020, 2:07 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Let us give one example of a difficult call. Yesterday, California announced 8316 tests had been administered, cumulatively. There is a big difference between 8316 tests and 8316 people tested (which would imply ~16k tests, by rough rule of thumb).</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 16, 2020, 2:07 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>In previous updates, CA had reported &quot;people tested.&quot; In context, though, the state might have meant &quot;tests.&quot;</p>
<p>We gave CA the benefit of the doubt and counted the higher number, then reached out for clarification (which we haven't gotten). And we tell you about the uncertainty. https://t.co/eNvjT67hte</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 18, 2020, 3:02 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The score contains 4 simple components:</p>
<ol>
<li>+1 for reporting positives reliably (only NV fails)</li>
<li>+1 for reporting negatives sometimes (e.g. NY, CA)</li>
<li>+1 for reporting negatives reliably</li>
<li>+1 for reporting all commercial tests</li>
</ol>
<p>(All labs have to report all positives.)</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 22, 2020, 2:33 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>(One last data note: we are not reporting California’s pending number because it has been published irregularly. But it is quite large—12,700–and worth considering when looking at the data.)</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 22, 2020, 7:11 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@Whitwyatt The pending data from California has come and gone. It makes it really difficult to track the states tests consistently. The number of tests bounces around in ways that really confuse people. A broader change is coming to our pending reporting.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 23, 2020, 7:17 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@nbashaw The California data is all over the place. They do have a lot of pending tests (~12k) —not included in our total—but it’s filtering through to completed tests really slowly. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 23, 2020, 3:38 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <ol start="3">
<li>One thing we’re tracking closely: California’s testing regime ramped up decently well, but the growth has really slowed down over the last few days. They’re also reporting a large (12k+) number of pending tests. We’re not sure what’s going on there.</li>
</ol>

      <p>Compare the number of completed tests reported by New Mexico, a state with a population 19 times smaller than California’s.</p>
<p>These numbers should not even be close, and yet they are. https://t.co/tzB9fZM6FP</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 23, 2020, 3:45 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Another CA note. The state had been reporting irregularly, so we were relying on high-quality media outlets like @latimes, who have an excellent tracker.</p>
<p>https://t.co/eL9bfy7uUa</p>
<p>Now that the state is reporting more regularly, we will be relying again on the state data.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 25, 2020, 2:20 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Over the past two days, it is worth noting that two large states have begun reporting more complete testing data. NJ yesterday and OH today both moved the numbers.</p>
<p>CA remains a major question mark. We hope to see movement there later today.</p>
<p>WA is not yet reporting outcomes.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 25, 2020, 2:31 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>California has finally provided an update. It's unclear if the total test count includes pending, but that's a large number of tests—second only to New York—and presumably includes commercial test providers.</p>
<p>https://t.co/GRXIpoPyGh</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 25, 2020, 2:40 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Snap analysis of this: it is a relief that California has tested ~40,000 more people than we knew until an hour ago.</p>
<p>That said, it's a huge state and we don't know how many of those tests are still pending (based on CA's previous reporting, it could be <em>a lot</em>).</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 25, 2020, 6:13 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>As expected, California has a large number of pending tests. But we did not expect the backlog to be this large. A lot more pending tests than completed ones.</p>

      <p>California’s testing situation remains the most puzzling of any state, which adds uncertainty in assessing the severity of the state’s overall outbreak.</p>

    <h2>March 26, 2020, 10:24 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@Lord_Loredo @James_Gross Yeah, California has been a bear for two reasons: 1) Their reporting has been very irregular (until recently). 2) They have reported on both sides of our daily 4pm commit. 3) They have dropped huge pending numbers the last 2 days (only one of which got captured in our daily #s)</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 26, 2020, 10:56 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@creatiwit @Lord_Loredo @James_Gross It's really the case. We've been tweeting about the weird situation in California for a while. We <em>think</em> it's that private testing companies are clogged up (3-4-5+ day wait times), but it could be logistics hurdles for state labs or something else entirely.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 27, 2020, 1:56 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>If you're waiting for the daily update, we're trying to get clarity on California's numbers right now. Standby.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 27, 2020, 2:39 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>In the end, we couldn't wait any longer. To preview what we did: we counted California's new positives and deaths, but we did not use the new total tests number that @GavinNewsom gave in his press conference because we can't parse pendings and negatives from that total.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 27, 2020, 3:11 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>As noted earlier, we had to do some work with California's numbers, as the comprehensive set had not come in by the time we published our daily update. Make sure you check out our best-available solution (which is still not ideal).</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 28, 2020, 3:09 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The California Situation continues. Just to do the math: if the positive/negative ratio stays the same (a big assumption), there could be more than 10k additional positives in California, which would give the state the second-most confirmed cases in the nation. https://t.co/cj34EYeW4O</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 28, 2020, 3:09 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>At this point, the private testing companies owe the state and nation an explanation for what's going on in California. Or some whistleblower should fill everyone in.</p>

    <h2>March 28, 2020, 7:14 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>@Corinacakes @sherijung In California, the problem may be a little different. But we’re still exploring that. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    <h2>March 29, 2020, 2:31 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>While we finalize, let me explain the problem. Our numbers lock at ~4pm ET each day. California's updates tend to fall right around this time, except when they don't, which has been happening. Right now, if we stick with only state numbers, we'd be looking at 4643 cases... https://t.co/dW5GrjgkIM</p>

      <p>These are the problems that are hard because there is no ideal solution. If we go with this data, we're more up-to-date on cases, but out of sync with the negatives and pending, at least until California officially updates again. If we don't, the numbers are misleadingly stale.</p>

      <p>Here's the dilemma: California has been very slow in reporting thus far. We've used other data sources for positive cases. Now that CA seems as if it is pulling its data together in a format more like other states, we'd like to use the official source.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 1, 2020, 2:30 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>OK, our final decision—after tortuous discussion—is to commit to this new California data for cases and deaths, relying on @GavinNewsom press conferences for other outcome data. We've left negative and pending tests intact, until the state provides an update.</p>

      <p>If you're a user of the data, this will affect your time series. But this brings California data more in line with the way we track the rest of the nation and we hope we don't have to deal with this issue again.</p>

      <p>Here’s what’s going on. As states switch from the long-established CDC system to the new HHS one, some hospitals appear to be having trouble reporting their numbers. That led both Texas and California to place advisories on their dashboards. https://t.co/fbq1Su5Nz2</p>
