      <p>On February 25, 2021, California announced that their deaths included a backlog of 806 deaths initially not reported as COVID-19 deaths from Los Angeles County. As a result, many of the deaths reported on February 25, 2021 occurred between December 3, 2020 and February 3, 2021. We urge caution when interpreting numbers from this period, and encourage the use of 7 and 14-day averages as more reliable metrics than individual figures.</p>
<p>On December 16, 2020, California <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-338.aspx">announced</a> that their cases for December 16, 2020 include 15,337 cases from previous days due to a change in case processing. It appears this new process will regularly include a higher volume of cases that were not identified within the previous 24 hours.</p>
<p>As of September 18, 2020, California's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>From July 23 through July 28, 2020, California reported that its <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> and <strong>Now in ICU</strong> were incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for this period if the complete data becomes available.</p>
<p>From June 29 to July 5, 2020, California made revisions to daily <strong>case</strong> numbers. On July 17, we updated the values based on the most recent data from the state dashboard.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2020, California data included a backlog from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. Approximately 1,000 of the 11,000 new cases were attributed to this backlog data.</p>
<p>As of April 22, 2020, California has reported specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.</p>
<p>On April 4 and April 22, 2020, California reported large batches of backlogged <strong>negative test</strong> data.</p>
<p>Prior to April 1, 2020, we used county data sources for more reliably timely reporting of California's COVID-19 data. At the start of April, we began reporting primarily from the state data dashboard(s). This led to a modest drop in <strong>cases</strong> and <strong>deaths</strong>, as the state's data lags behind the county sources.</p>

    <div>
      <p>Prior to April 1, 2020, we used county data sources for more reliably timely reporting of California's COVID-19 data. At the start of April, we began reporting primarily from the state data dashboard(s). This led to a modest drop in <strong>cases</strong> and <strong>deaths</strong>, as the state's data lags behind the county sources.</p>
<p>On April 4 and April 22, 2020, California reported large batches of backlogged <strong>negative test</strong> data.</p>
<p>As of April 22, 2020, California has reported specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2020, California data included a backlog from Los Angeles County, which had not reported for several days. Approximately 1,000 of the 11,000 new cases were attributed to this backlog data.</p>
<p>From June 29 to July 5, 2020, California made revisions to daily <strong>case</strong> numbers. On July 17, we updated the values based on the most recent data from the state dashboard.</p>
<p>From July 23 through July 28, 2020, California reported that its <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> and <strong>Now in ICU</strong> were incomplete due to its transition to the HHS reporting system. We carried over hospitalization figures until July 28. We will backfill the complete numbers for this period if the complete data becomes available.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>

      <p>California has been inconsistent in its timing of reporting. We used faster-updating sources until 4/1, when we standardized on its <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19PublicDashboard/Covid-19Public?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=no&amp;:showVizHome=no">new data dashboards</a>. This led to a drop in cases and deaths, as the state's data lags county sources. The state reported a huge batch of negative tests on April 4 and again on April 22. As of April 22, California now reports specimens tested instead of people tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.</p>

      <p>On 3/27, we know CA lists 88,400 total tests, but they have not split them out between negatives and pending. So we've added new positive and death numbers, but not new negatives or pending. We'll update as soon as the state releases complete numbers.

      <p>We report positives from the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/">LA Times</a>, which is aggregated from county-level data and is ahead of the official California data site. When using LA Times data for positives, we do not add deaths to the positive count: they are already included. Previously we added them in because the California state site had not been including them in the positive count. Negative numbers are inferred from Totals - Positives, taken from the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-028.aspx">latest press release</a>. We are not reporting pending numbers until they are reported regularly, or from a dashboard.  We assume 1 test=1 person.</p>

      <p>The state website only reports positives, but we have confirmation from the state that there were 916 people who tested negative, as of 3/10. When the state updates the positive number, our numbers fall of out alignment. This number is necessarily inaccurate, but less inaccurate than a 0 in that cell. So, enter 916.</p>
<p>Also, California has started reporting deaths alongside “positive cases”. Deaths are not included in California's positive number. We include them in a separate column.</p>
