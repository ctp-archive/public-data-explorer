            <p>I took a quick look at this and the screenshots are kind of a mess before April. Some of them have no data, others are of the Los Angeles Times instead of a state source, etc. Maybe a better source is the California  health department press releases, which are nearly daily? https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/New-Release-2020.aspx  However even there, we will have to decide how to deal with a bunch of old school issues like whether to include &quot;Federal repatriation flights&quot;.</p>

        <p>Starting on March 30th, the California reporting structure changed, displaying a “California COVID-19 By the Numbers” infographic. This image reports the data for the day according to the end-of-day values from the previous day. The CTP starts recording this data as a primary source on April 2nd, except it enters the data on the day the graphic is published, not the day referenced in the graphic. So the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR20-041.aspx">April 2nd graphic</a> matches the CTP data for April 2nd, however the graphic lists them as end-of-day numbers for April 1st.</p>
<p>Need to shift <strong>all</strong> CA numbers so that they reflect CA's &quot;Numbers as of $date&quot;, not the press release date ($date+1). Day forward recording needs to be enter numbers for $date in the actual matching day as well.</p>
<p>This change is important for consistency and modeling.</p>
<p>For March fixes (which include similar off-by-one errors, among others), please see:

Thanks for bringing this to our attention! CA updated its data after our publish time cutoff. If a state updates after that time, we catch that update on the following day. See my response to #431 and #432 for further discussion.</p>

<p>Off-by-a-day errors aside, it makes sense to use official state reported confirmed case and death numbers for a date when those are higher than current CTP reported values. It is unlikely the state is making up higher positive case and death counts.</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>@scarson</strong>,
Thanks again for bringing these discrepancies to our attention. For an explanation of why these numbers may differ from ours, see #431. You are 100% right that some of these discrepancies for 3/18-31 are big (we generally do not worry about off-by-one lags, so the pendings + days where the counts are different are the ones we'd like to correct). We have a team working to determine how and whether to update data from historical sources in event of discrepancies like this. I will flag this as a potential source of data to them.</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>@scarson</strong>,
Thank you for bringing this to our attention. For those dates, we do not use the press releases to get case information, but the CA COVID homepage (see <a href="https://covidtracking.com/screenshots/CA/CA-20200316-105418.png">this screenshot</a> for an example). The press releases for CA seem to have come out later than we would check the website, explaining why the numbers are different than ours on these early days. We publish the daily stats every afternoon. If a state updates the number of tests or cases after that time, we catch that update on the following day. You can check the exact time we looked at the CA website in the &quot;lastUpdateET&quot; field of the API.
I hope this is helpful!</p>

            <p>The CA state public dashboard got updated this morning and it now shows the huge 61% increase in negative results on 4/22, with this footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The increase in number of tests conducted on 4/22 is due to the addition of data sources to reflect a more complete count of testing in California.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The positive rate dropped in one day from 11.1% to 7.6%.  The lack of any additional explanation doesn't inspire confidence.</p>
<p>I guess this project must have an alternative path to the state data other than the public dashboard, since &quot;states_current&quot; was showing data for 4/22 yesterday evening while the dashboard said &quot;Last updated 4/21/2020&quot; and showed that day's data.</p>

<p>Hi. I'm REDACTED at The Sacramento Bee in California. I think the proper number for deaths in CA on Sat, April 11 is 609. (You have 541 two days in a row.) You can see 609 in the 9:03pm screenshot for Sat. April 11. Do you think someone could look at and adjust? We are huge fans of all work on this</p>

            <p>There seems to be a discrepancy between the <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/state/california">text description</a> for CA on the state's data page and what's actually happening with the CA data. The former says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>until 4/1, when we standardized on California's new data dashboards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the current best data source and the screen shots (and the data) are still from <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx">the CDPH website</a>.</p>
<p>The dashboard does seem to have more detailed data.</p>
<p>PS Notice that the dashboard is reporting a whole string of nice even numbers for testing totals, which are therefore obviously not accurate. See #141.</p>

            <p>I pulled the data from the California Health &amp; Home Service Agency (CHHS) site and compared it to the data for California coming from the Github site and found two discrepancies.  Note CHHS is only reporting data from April 1 2020.  If it is now the current source of record it must have been added on or after April 1.  Also, the two pieces of data coming from CHHS appear to be “Total Count Confirmed” which ends up in the “Positive” column on GitHub and “Total Count Deaths” which is in the “Deaths” column in GitHub.  The data from CHHS and GitHub for Positive and Deaths match perfectly with two exceptions.</p>
<ol>
<li>CHHS dates are not aligned with GitHub:  CHHS data begins on 4/1/20.  Data for 4/1/20 in the CHHS dataset appears in GitHub in 4/2/20 a day later.  Is there a good reason from this?  If not this should be fixed.</li>
<li>Incorrect Data in GitHub for 1/11/20: Data for “Positive” 4/11/20 (current dating scheme) should be 20,615 vice 21,794.  Data for “Deaths” for that day should be 609 vice 651.</li>
</ol>
<p>This assumes, of course, that CHHS data is the preferred source for “Positive” and “Death” data for the GitHub DB.  I’m a newbie on GitHub so this is as much as I can do to rectify the data errors I see.</p>
<p>Here is the URL for the CHHS dataset:  <a href="https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6882c390-b2d7-4b9a-aefa-2068cee63e47/resource/6cd8d424-dfaa-4bdd-9410-a3d656e1176e/download/covid19data.csv">https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6882c390-b2d7-4b9a-aefa-2068cee63e47/resource/6cd8d424-dfaa-4bdd-9410-a3d656e1176e/download/covid19data.csv</a> https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/6882c390-b2d7-4b9a-aefa-2068cee63e47/resource/6cd8d424-dfaa-4bdd-9410-a3d656e1176e/download/covid19data.csv</p>
<p>I hope this helps make the Github data more representative of the actual situation.</p>

Subject: Re: [COVID19Tracking/issues] CA confusion (#181)</p>
<p>There seems to be a discrepancy between the text description <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/state/california">https://covidtracking.com/data/state/california</a>  for CA on the state's data page and what's actually happening with the CA data. The former says:</p>
<p>until 4/1, when we standardized on California's new data dashboards.</p>
<p>But the current best data source and the screen shots (and the data) are still from the CDPH website <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx">https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx</a> .</p>
<p>The dashboard does seem to have more detailed data.</p>
<p>PS Notice that the dashboard is reporting a whole string of nice even numbers for testing totals, which are therefore obviously not accurate. See #141 <a href="https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/141">https://github.com/COVID19Tracking/issues/issues/141</a> .</p>

            <p>John,</p>
<p>The frequency of results that are multiples of 100 does strain the appearance of credibility.  I’ve be concentrating on the “Positive Infection” and “Death” numbers both of which are cumulative. To me the number that is most suspect is the “Pending” tests.  If the information in the attached article is correct then then testing, particularly in California, is not well organized or managed and therefore the numbers coming out of that process are likely to be suspect.  This would include “positives” and “negatives” but most especially “pending”.</p>
<p>If the testing process is opaque so are the criteria for placing a case in one or another of the categories.  For example, do people who died from COVID 19 but were never tested end up in the positive infection cume?  Do these criteria vary by county?  This is clearly our first rodeo but not our last.  I hope that there will be significant pressure to improve the timeliness and accuracy of the data and visibility to them as well.  It’s not just bookkeeping; actual “life and death” management decisions will be made based on these numbers.</p>

            <p><strong>@sluggo1133</strong> Yes, this great project has made it quite clear that testing and reporting in the US are a mess. CA is just one example. Hopefully one of the outcomes is the establishment of national standards.</p>
<p>WRT CA, pending is clearly heavily rounded. What I don't understand is how &quot;tested&quot; is rounded as well. To my mind, it's clear that CA's negative numbers are fairly unreliable.</p>

        <p>Something seems odd with the recent CA numbers:</p>
<ol>
<li>They got 47,000 pending tests back today and they were effectively all negative. In fact their positive increase was lower than yesterday.</li>
<li>Even ignoring the returned pending cases, they added 30k new test results when the most they've been able to do before is 7k (once, over a month ago).</li>
<li>For the third straight day, their totalTestResults were an even multiple of 100.</li>
<li>For the past two days, their totalTestResultsIncrease was likewise a multiple of 100.</li>
<li>Their pending cases have also been -00, but I had figured that was just routine rounding.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel a little conspiracy-addled even writing this, but #1 seems so incredible to me that the others seem worth mentioning as well. This isn't a direct issue for the project, but perhaps someone has a way to ask them about this.</p>

            <p>In retrospect, California probably should not have had as high a grade as it did.</p>
<p>We’re working on a system to attach grades to data on a daily basis, so you could go back and see that sort of thing.</p>
<p>As it stands, we do not have that system in place. And for right now, I think California is now a B.</p>

<p>Thanks, but how does CA rate a grade of B? They clearly have not been reporting negatives with any reliability. Is it clear where the other 30k test results came from?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. My jury is still out. :-)</p>
<p>If you will be adding grades like that, I'd suggest practical categories, like &quot;reliable for positive rate&quot; and so on.</p>

        <p>On the off chance that you haven't noticed, the CA DPH subdomain seems to have disappeared from the web. Not sure where the screw up is, but DNS are not finding the address. Perhaps you have some contact (when they wake up out there).</p>
<p>EDIT: It seems like my Italy IP address is stopping this from loading for me. No idea why, but if I have a US address, it loads fine. Closing, but confused.</p>

        <p>First off, thank you all for your hard work!</p>
<p>I was looking at California data and was searching for where the testing numbers came from.  I noticed two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The screenshots for California are cut off.  They only show the top part of the page without scrolling. This is the most recent screenshot (March 31st <strong>@</strong> 6pm)
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4970365/78087606-3bd7d080-7387-11ea-9ecd-65185fb3d574.png" alt="image"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The linked &quot;Best Current Data Source&quot; website doesn't list the number of tests.  California has a different website that does have testing data: <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/">https://covid19.ca.gov/</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you!
