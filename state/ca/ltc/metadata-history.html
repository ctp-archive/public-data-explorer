    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div>
      California reports long-term care data for Skilled Nursing Facilities and Adult and Residential Care Facilities for the elderly. They are reported separately.

Skilled Nursing Facility cumulative data starts on January 1, 2020 and is updated daily. California Skilled Nursing Facilities deaths include those that occurred at Nursing Homes and those that occurred in other locations, such as a hospital or private home, if the death occurred within the 14-day bed hold period after the resident transferred from the Nursing Facility. Deaths that occurred outside of this 14-day period may not be captured. Reported data categorizes by resident or staff cases and deaths. 

Adult and Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly licensed by the California Department of Social Services, Community Care Licensing Division does not list facilities with a capacity for seven or more persons in care, which reflects in a lower number of facilities. Residential Care Facility data reports residents and staff combined. 

September 3, 2020: Nursing Home facility number carried from August 27, 2020. 

October 1, 2020: Nursing Home facility number carried from September 24, 2020. 

October 29, 2020: Nursing Home facility number carried from October 22, 2020

July 16, 2020: Residential Care Facilities report current active cases. This information, placed in the outbreak category, consists of cases that were diagnosed in the last 29 days and for which no death was reported.

November 4, 2020: California changed the definition of an &quot;active&quot; case for Residential Care Facilities. 

January 21, 2021: Cumulative nursing home facility count is 1079 this week, but last week it was 1197. Facility count was carried over from last week.

      California&#39;s skilled nursing facilities do not include deaths of residents that occurred in a different location 14-days after a resident is transferred to another setting, such as a hospital. This may result in an undercount of long-term-care deaths. Interpret California deaths with caution.

      California&#39;s skilled nursing facilities do not include deaths of residents that occurred in a different location 14-days after a resident is transferred to another setting, such as a hospital.
