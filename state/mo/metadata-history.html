<p>On November 21, 2020, Missouri’s <strong>Total PCR Tests (People)</strong> increased by less than <strong>Confirmed cases</strong>. As a result, <strong>Negative (People or Cases)</strong> saw a decline from the previous day since it is calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>
<p>On November 10, 2020, Missouri’s Total PCR tests (specimens), Negative PCR tests (specimens), Total PCR tests (people), Total antibody tests (specimens), Total antibody tests (people), Negative antibody tests (specimens), Total antigen tests (specimens), and Negative antigen tests (specimens) dropped without explanation.</p>
<p>On November 8, 2020, Missouri's <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased from 2,672,288 to 2,654,691 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2020, Missouri testing numbers by people decreased. This resulted in a decrease in all total testing numbers (people) and negative cases. Testing numbers by specimen are unaffected.</p>
