    <div>
      Missouri reports long-term care data for Skilled Nursing Facilities, Intermediate Care Facilities, Assisted Living Facilities and Residential Care Facilities that provide nursing or convalescent care. Missouri only reports the number cases in of long-term care facilities in the past 7 days. Each facility had at least 1 resident or staff member with COVID-19. Missouri does not report facility-level data.

From July 30, 2020 to January 28, 2021, CTP used St. Louis County&#39;s data because it was more comprehensive than the data the state of Missouri was providing. CTP switched to reporting data from the state on January 28, 2021, after Missouri began releasing cumulative statewide numbers. 


July 30, 2020: CTP began reporting St. Louis County resident cases and deaths due to Missouri not releasing any information other than the of number of facilities with a COVID-19 case.

September 10, 2020: St. Louis released a report on September 2, 2020 with updated numbers, including backfilling efforts for cases for July and August. CTP has updated data to reflect this change. 

October 22, 2020: Missouri&#39;s dashboard changed and the state now provides resident cases by county over the past 7 days. Facility count is no longer given. CTP continues to report cases and deaths from St. Louis County as this is the only available representation of this data. This case and death data only represents a portion of cases and deaths in the state. Before this reporting switch, Missouri provided the cumulative number of facilities with a case.

October 29, 2020: Missouri is reporting resident cases in LTC facilities in the past 7 days. This total is reported in the Outbreak category. 

December 17, 2020: Missouri’s LTC dashboard is down. Data is carried over from December 10, 2020.

December 24, 2020: Missouri’s LTC dashboard is down. Data is carried over from December 10, 2020.

January 7, 2021: Missouri&#39;s LTC dashboard is down. Data is carried over from December 10, 2020.

January 21, 2021: Missouri&#39;s LTC dashboard is down. Data is carried over from December 10, 2020.

January 28, 2021: Missouri released cumulative data for cumulative cases and deaths in long-term-care facilities on their dashboard for the first time. CTP stopped collecting St. Louis County data.
