    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Currently, the federal government does not use data directly provided by WA in its PCR testing dataset (accessible here: https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-diagnostic-laboratory-testing-pcr-testing-time-series), as it does for most jurisdictions. Instead, it uses data submitted directly by laboratories in WA, which appears to be incomplete data—about 26% lower than WA's test count on its dashboard.</p>
<p>Does WA submit any COVID-19 testing data to the federal government, either in aggregate or at the line level? If so, do you know why the CDC and HHS do not use WA's submitted data in public datasets? If not, why doesn’t WA submit data to the federal government?</p>

      <p>Two weeks ago, South Carolina released a full, facility-level data page of vaccination in Long Term Care centers: https://cvshealth.com/sites/default/files/cvs-health-covid-19-vaccination-data.pdf. Since South Carolina released facility-level vaccination data in LTC, we believe every state likely has the same access to this data. Is this true for Washington? Can you provide facility-level data of vaccine distribution to long-term-care facilities on your website?</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We noticed a conflict between two notes on your data dashboard page (https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/DataDashboard) with regard to how Washington reports COVID deaths. Within the dashboard, there is some text stating &quot;Probable cases are individuals with a positive antigen test for COVID-19...&quot; and &quot;Hospitalizations and deaths are reported among confirmed and probable cases.&quot; This led us to believe that a positive molecular or antigen test was required in order for a death to be counted as a COVID death. But at the bottom of the same page, there is text stating: &quot;As of December 10, 2020, death counts on our dashboard reflect those... where the cause of death was confirmed or suspected to have been COVID-19...&quot; The presence of the word &quot;suspected&quot; here indicates to us that a positive antigen test is not necessary for a death to count as a COVID death.  Could you please clarify?</p>

        <div>
          <p>Washington state continues to track both suspected and positive (confirmed) COVID patients in our hospitals. We receive these data from hospitals and display them in separate columns on our dashboards. The numbers you’ve provided seem to be for COVID positive cases only; for the total number of COVID suspected and positive patients in Washington hospitals, you’d need to add these columns.</p>
<p>Hospitals in Washington state are required to report metrics on their bed capacity and occupancy, critical staffing needs, equipment, and PPE supplies to the state every day using the WA HEALTH data system. This requirement is separate from (and in addition to) hospital reporting requirements for the federal government. Hospital staff manually input these data each day. This work is often done by frontline staff who already have very limited time available, so some variances may result.</p>

          <p>Hospitals in our state have reported directly to HHS since July, however we’re now working to be able to upload these data to HHS on their behalf. This should reduce variances between federal and state data platforms as well as the burden on hospital staff. However, the timing of reporting by both WA HEALTH and HHS can also cause some differences in the data.</p>

          <p>If done for diagnosis it would be reported like all others positive, negative or indeterminant.</p>

          <p>Yes, but not pooling. We are not actively tracking or reporting on antigen testing at this time. However, if a lab collects it and reports it, it would go into our electronic system. Any of that preliminary data, without proper review, would be incomplete, inaccurate, and not helpful in producing worthwhile analysis.</p>

          <p>From pooling? None that we have been made aware of. Without a system in place to ensure we are capturing the full scope of antigen testing taking place, any data we may have captured would be highly preliminary, incomplete, and therefore not useful. (Reporter note: I had sent this with the antigen question, but they separated out the follow-up questions.)</p>
