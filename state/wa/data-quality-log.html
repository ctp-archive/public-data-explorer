        <p>On February 2, 2021, Washington [reported](https://covidtracking.com/screenshots/WA/WA-20210203-004235.png) that its death data would not be updated until February 3, 2021. Since WA is on a one-day lag in our time series, the death counts reported on February 4, 2021 will include two days of data. In addition, possibly because of its ongoing &quot;processing issues&quot; beginning November 21, 2021, Washington's cumulative death count decreased by two on February 3, 2021.</p>

        <p>On August 26, 2020, Washington switched its total tests units to testing encounters, excluding future encounters from individuals who test positive. It also provided a full timeseries of the figure. This testing encounters figure is slightly different from how we define testing encounters in two ways: first, our definition of testing encounters includes encounters after a positive test, and second, it should be calculated not by summing resulted tests but by counting all daily tests in a separate reporting stream. Despite these differences, the historical and current values of Washington’s figure are still stored in our testing encounters field.</p>

We estimate this will take at least one week.&quot; <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Newsroom/Articles/ID/1331/Washington-state-changes-negative-test-reporting-for-COVID-19">https://www.doh.wa.gov/Newsroom/Articles/ID/1331/Washington-state-changes-negative-test-reporting-for-COVID-19</a></p>
