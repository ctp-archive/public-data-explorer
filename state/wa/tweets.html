      <p>New  update with state data up to midnight eastern: tally shows over 4000 tests.</p>
<p>https://t.co/Zc39AZVRge</p>
<p>WA and CA have conducted the most tests and have the most cases. Big gaps in our testing capacity knowledge: MA, TX, GA, PA.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 11, 2020, 1:22 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We are tracking the number of people who have been tested here, which is different from &quot;number of tests,&quot; which is what the CDC has released so far.</p>
<p>Washington has tested the most people and has the most cases (267). NY now second for cases at 216.</p>

    <h2>March 12, 2020, 9:50 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Some big new numbers came in since our 3/12 4pm update. Thanks to @NYGovCuomo, we now have a total tested for New York: 2,314, with 328 positives.</p>
<p>Washington also updated. They've tested 4,807 people. 426 positives.</p>

    <h2>March 13, 2020, 1:54 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>A few thoughts on why we counted more than 6,600 new tests today:</p>
<ol>
<li>WA, which accounts for nearly 30% of all reported tests in the US, did not report before 4 pm ET yesterday.</li>
<li>NY reported total tests last night for the first time.</li>
</ol>

    <h2>March 13, 2020, 11:33 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Closing up the shop for the night. We're showing 19,066 tests. 2,182 positives. Here are the four states with the largest known outbreaks: WA, NY, CA, MA. https://t.co/LrCchHRS3V</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 14, 2020, 1:41 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The biggest news today is that we got a fresh total test number from MA, which had been lacking. We do not have a fresh number for Washington State, which is doing the most testing. Among smaller states, the situations in Louisiana and Colorado stand out. https://t.co/qSmFF4SLva</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 14, 2020, 1:50 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@joshtpm Washington and New York are driving the numbers. We're falling further behind on CA testing numbers. Now that MA is out in the open, the other big question mark is TX.</p>

    <h2>March 15, 2020, 1:35 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>By known positive tests, the 10 states with the highest per capita number of cases are:
Washington
New York

Massachusetts
Louisiana
Rhode Island

    <h2>March 16, 2020, 12:19 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Big end of night update. @GavinNewsom put out a new number for California testing (8300 total), which really boosted things.</p>
<p>We're seeing 38,631 people tested, up more than 10k since our 4pm ET update.</p>
<p>CA and WA combined have now done ~48% of testing in our data. https://t.co/LSjuCN2vQg</p>

    <h2>March 17, 2020, 11:15 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>End of day, 3/17, we have confirmed cases in all 50 states + DC and 3 territories, almost 6000 in total. WA and NY are now over 1000 cases each. Of the smaller states, Louisiana, Colorado, and Rhode Island look like hot spots. https://t.co/LzKJBXTD0J</p>

      <p>@NateSilver538 WA also a usable example simply because the data is gloriously solid, relatively speaking. (OTOH, one other shade to this data: they hit a testing wall, which might be part of the flatter trend. Happy to discuss if you are interested.) -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 19, 2020, 2:28 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The other number that jumps off the page is New York's testing ramp. But it's actually 4th in per-capita testing behind Washington, Maine, and New Mexico. https://t.co/HmeRyEjyrV</p>

      <p>New York accelerated past Washington in per capita positive tests. Here’s the top 10:</p>
<p>New York
Washington
New Jersey
Louisiana
DC
Michigan
Massachusetts
Colorado
Rhode Island
Illinois</p>

    <h2>March 22, 2020, 2:25 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>New York continues to have the highest positive tests per capita, an indication of both the intensity of testing there and the severity of the outbreak. Here’s the top 10:</p>
<p>New York
Washington
New Jersey
Louisiana
DC
Michigan
Illinois
Vermont
Colorado
Rhode Island</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 22, 2020, 2:26 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Based on the 15 states that report this metric: The number of people hospitalized has grown to 2,544, most of them in New York. It’s worth noting: Washington State does not disclose this number (yet).</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 23, 2020, 9:46 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@tangerinelaw @JohnsHopkinsEPI Some of it is time. It takes time for the deaths to come. The other part is that it's spiky: deaths come in much higher numbers when the population is vulnerable and the hospital system gets overwhelmed (Italy) or gets surprised (Kirkland,WA). -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 25, 2020, 2:20 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Over the past two days, it is worth noting that two large states have begun reporting more complete testing data. NJ yesterday and OH today both moved the numbers.</p>
<p>CA remains a major question mark. We hope to see movement there later today.</p>
<p>WA is not yet reporting outcomes.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 27, 2020, 10:09 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Less than half the states are reporting hospitalization numbers in any way. Washington is among the states missing and presumably has the second largest number of hospitalized people (because of severity and duration of its outbreak).</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 1, 2020, 2:56 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Another current known data problem is Washington State. After rock-solid reporting through the early part of the outbreak, their system got gummed up, and we have not seen a new update from the state for days.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 2, 2020, 12:01 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Update: Washington’s dashboard is back up. Cumulative completed tests now stand at ~75k.</p>
<p>Surprising: only ~10k tests over the last 3 days of reported data.</p>
<p>https://t.co/lr1VJ3N67U</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 2, 2020, 3:11 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Some good state news: Washington's testing capacity seems to be all right. They had some data reporting problems, but also, it seemed as if testing was legitimately down. Nearly 8k tests reported though. https://t.co/ge8w2sLOh9</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 6, 2020, 3:45 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@esandeen @supermills @alexismadrigal Not necessarily subsided but flattened in WA, CA, and —perhaps—NY. The waves are overlapping, though. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 8, 2020, 1:57 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Heading into our daily update, we wanted to take a look back at where we are with testing. CA did the first early testing. Then WA started pumping out tests. But NY now dominates. (Graphics by: @samirrayani and @tophtucker) https://t.co/dPzCmzYjI4</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 9, 2020, 3:25 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@deptofnumbers We've had some explicit communications with WA trying to sort out some of the changes in their reporting. If you look at the total number of tests, it is fewer than we currently show based on what WA used to report. We're trying to figure it out. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 27, 2020, 10:55 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@covidtrace1 @dougnlamb @sonofrona @alexismadrigal We do, when that is possible (see, recently: MA and WA). It's not always possible. They just dump a bunch of negatives every few days. You could smooth out a lot of it with some multi-day averaging. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>May 25, 2020, 2:46 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Last note: Washington DC's total test count fell by ~22%, presumably pulling out antibody tests.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 18, 2020, 2:21 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The variation between states/territories is also fascinating. DC told the Washington Post it doesn't report probables because it doesn't have any. Delaware, meanwhile, with a comparable total case count, reports nearly 1,000 probable cases.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 18, 2020, 3:27 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Two notes in the numbers today:</p>
<p>Washington State revealed they had been counting antibody tests in its numbers, so their total number of tests will drop.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we accidentally counted Mississippi's antibody tests in its total. We're correcting the data today.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 14, 2020, 3:01 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The recent rise in deaths is not equally distributed across the US. Where cases have risen most rapidly, deaths have followed suit.</p>
<p>Note: the West’s death number is impacted by Washington State removing 39 deaths from their counts that they determined were not from COVID-19. https://t.co/Feh8IVK6Oh</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>July 23, 2020, 4:02 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>Texas moved into the top 10 in the total number of COVID-19 deaths that the state has reported this year. Washington, hit hard early, has now fallen out of the top 20. https://t.co/XFiutAyId6</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>August 8, 2020, 3:11 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We’ve mentioned data and testing reporting problems in CA and FL this week, and should also flag that WA is having IT trouble that has prevented the state from reporting negative results since 8/1 and is lowering hosp. numbers. https://t.co/nKEg5t7i1g https://t.co/g45EJgWSBQ</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>August 10, 2020, 4:24 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>CA is not the only state struggling with reporting issues: Washington, for instance, has not reported negative test numbers since August 1st. https://t.co/fOgkXtKwRD</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>August 12, 2020, 4:42 PM PDT</h2>

    <h2>August 29, 2020, 3:23 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>The Washington State DOH noted that they will no longer report COVID-19 deaths over the weekend starting today. Weekend COVID-19 deaths in the state will be included in Monday and Tuesday counts.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>September 1, 2020, 1:50 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>This illuminates a failure to protect these groups after COVID-19’s impact on them was known. The first US outbreak occurred at a Washington nursing home in late February, but @CMSGov didn’t set data collection requirements until May 8 and didn’t begin reporting data until June 1</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>September 8, 2020, 3:41 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Our daily update is published. States reported 508k tests, 22k cases, and 358 deaths.</p>
<p>These are low figures for a Tuesday, as reporting is likely impacted by the holiday weekend. WA reported no numbers today as the state website is down due to local storms. https://t.co/pTPt5igltb</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>September 18, 2020, 12:43 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Update for our data users - we continued to implement changes to our original totalTestResults API field, resulting in a ~600k cumulative test increase since March.</p>
<p>We updated test totals for 14 states: AK, AL, AR, AS, CA, DC, GA, ID, KY, MN, NH, SD, VA, and WA.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>October 13, 2020, 4:33 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>It’s important to note that, sadly, our numbers are an undercount since not all states have been reporting data in the past few days. Both Missouri and Washington haven't updated any numbers since October 10. Arkansas also missed today's update.</p>

    <h2>December 1, 2020, 4:35 PM PST</h2>
