    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <div>
      <p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>Tennessee continually updates its <strong>Currently hospitalized / Now hospitalized</strong> data which can cause differences between their historic data and ours.</p>
<p>On March 7, 2021, Tennessee did not provide an update before the end of our daily publication shift.</p>
<p>As of March 1, 2021, Tennessee's <code>totalTestResults</code> field is taken directly from <code>totalTestsViral</code> instead of calculated from positive + negative. We backfilled the data for March 24, 2020 through March 1, 2021 using the time-series posted in Tennessee's <a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/ncov/data/downloadable-datasets.html">Downloadable Datasets</a>. We also cleared the history of Negative (people or cases) since it was calculated using mixed units.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2020, Tennessee announced that due to the volume of tests being processed they will likely release a combined report with data from both December 19, 2020 and December 20, 2020 on December 20, 2020. As a result, we were unable to update their data on December 20, 2020.</p>
