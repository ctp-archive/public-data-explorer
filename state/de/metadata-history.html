    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <div>
      <p>On February 5, 2021, Delaware <a href="">announced</a> via the official Delaware Department of Health and Social Services twitter that 54 of the deaths reported on February 5, 2021 were identified as the result of a data quality review. As a result, the majority of new deaths reported on February 5, 2021 were not identified in the previous 24 hour period.</p>
<p>On February 7, 2021, Delaware noted that due to a technical issue it was reporting 260 cases reported to DPH on February 5 as well as the new cases reported on February 6.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2020, Delaware announced that due to laboratory reporting delays, the number of cases reported for December 17, 2020 is lower than previous days, and the number of cases reported for December 18, 2020 would be higher than previous days to make up for it. Because Delaware reports their data as of the previous day, this affects our data for December 18, 2020 and December 19, 2020.</p>
<p>Throughout the week of December 17, 2020, Delaware experienced technical issues with lab reporting. Please exercise caution when looking at their data from this period and be aware that 7 day averages are a more reliable metric than individual figures.</p>
<p>On December 7, 2020, Delaware announced that they would no longer be reporting <strong>Recovered</strong> as it was “no longer a true reflection of the number of persons that recovered from the disease” because this metric included only cases who had self-reported their recovery to the Division of Public Health. Due to this we cannot continue reporting <strong>Recovered</strong>, however the time series for this metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2020, we moved the data in our <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong> field for Delaware to the <strong>Total Test Encounters (PCR)</strong> field after learning that it represents encounters from Delaware's state health department. However, Delaware appears to include antigen tests in its totals, so if an individual is tested using two different test types on the same day, it will get counted twice. Also as of October 29, 2020, Delaware's <code>totalTestResults</code> field represents encounters. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code> field.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2020, Delaware reported that  data from September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 would not be available until September 10, 2020 due to a maintenance issue with their electronic reporting system.

    <h3>Notes</h3>

      <p>Throughout the week of December 17, 2020, Delaware has experienced technical issues with lab reporting. Please exercise caution when looking at their data from this period and be aware that 7 day averages are a more reliable metric than individual figures.</p>
<p>On February 7, 2021, Delaware noted that due to a technical issue it was reporting 260 cases reported to DPH on February 5 as well as the new cases reported on February 6.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2020, Delaware announced that due to laboratory reporting delays, the number of cases reported for December 17, 2020 is lower than previous days, and the number of cases reported for December 18, 2020 would be higher than previous days to make up for it. Because Delaware reports their data as of the previous day, this affects our data for December 18, 2020 and December 19, 2020.</p>
<p>On December 7, 2020, Delaware announced that they would no longer be reporting <strong>Recovered</strong> as it was “no longer a true reflection of the number of persons that recovered from the disease” because this metric included only cases who had self-reported their recovery to the Division of Public Health. Due to this we cannot continue reporting <strong>Recovered</strong>, however the time series for this metric is available in the historical data, and our data downloads.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2020, we moved the data in our <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong> field for Delaware to the <strong>Total Test Encounters (PCR)</strong> field after learning that it represents encounters from Delaware's state health department. However, Delaware appears to include antigen tests in its totals, so if an individual is tested using two different test types on the same day, it will get counted twice. Also as of October 29, 2020, Delaware's <code>totalTestResults</code> field represents encounters. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code> field.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2020, Delaware reported that  data from September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 would not be available until September 10, 2020 due to a maintenance issue with their electronic reporting system. We will backfill data for September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 to the best of our abilities when data is released</p>

    <div>
      <p>On October 29, 2020, we moved the data in our <strong>Total Tests (PCR)</strong> field for Delaware to the <strong>Total Test Encounters (PCR)</strong> field after learning that it represents encounters from Delaware's state health department. However, Delaware appears to include antigen tests in its totals, so if an individual is tested using two different test types on the same day, it will get counted twice. Also as of October 29, 2020, Delaware's <code>totalTestResults</code> field represents encounters. The number of unique people ever tested remains available in the <code>totalTestsPeopleViral</code> field.</p>
<p>On September 9, 2020, Delaware reported that  data from September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 would not be available until September 10, 2020 due to a maintenance issue with their electronic reporting system. We will backfill data for September 8, 2020 and September 9, 2020 to the best of our abilities when data is released</p>
<p>On September 6, 2020, the Division of Public Health reported a technical issue which caused between 175-200 positive cases to be excluded from Delaware's cumulative confirmed case count. These cases will be added in the coming days. As a result new cases reported may not have been diagnosed in the past 24 hour period.</p>
<p>On August 27, 2020, Delaware revised down total cases and confirmed positives. This is a semi-regular occurrence which will impact Delware's number occasionally.</p>
