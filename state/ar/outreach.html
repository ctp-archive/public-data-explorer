    <h2>April 2, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The total test count in AR is negative tests + positive cases. For some research we're doing comparing state and federal testing numbers, it would be really helpful for us to know as a one-time number, how many positive tests (including repeat positive testing) there have been?</p>

    </div>
    
  
    <h2>February 17, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>AR reports a percentage of people who have died that were Hispanic. Are all the other people who have died known to have been non-Hispanic, or are there any people for whom ethnicity was unknown?</p>

    </div>
    
  
    <h2>February 15, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We have been comparing our data to the CDC Cases and Deaths data (https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36). We found that the total number of cases matches perfectly between AR’s dashboard and the CDC reports. We found however that in the CDC data your probable cases are not recorded in the Probable Cases field (prob_cases), but are recorded in the daily New Probable Cases field (pnew_case). When we sum the values of the daily pnew_case we get the exact same number of probable cases reported by Arkansas.</p>
<p>We were wondering if you had any ideas why this might be happening?</p>
<p>Illustrative screenshot (attached)
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1293se2S6G1jxB7SNcPZbpuM_dYc19LP_DT0G3IaXElM/edit</p>
<p>We are also interested in the process of cases and deaths reporting to the federal government in general. We understand from the CDC website that there is a process of the CDC collecting and then confirming aggregate numbers from each jurisdiction, and that this aggregate reporting complements line level reporting (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html).
Can you tell us about the different mechanisms of reporting cases and deaths to the federal government (voluntary NNDS, aggregate counts process, and line level reporting from the state health department)? We are particularly interested in the aggregate count process as it appears to be the source of the state-level data published by the federal government regularly.</p>

        <div>
          <p>On the first question, that does appear that the probable cases are being recorded in the new probable cases field. But our team thinks this is on the CDC’s end – they don’t see what would be causing that based on our data.
 
On the second one, we send a de-identified file each day that is a line list of every single case and includes deaths. We resend this database every day, so any changes would be recorded.</p>

    <h2>February 2, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>For cases and deaths, we wanted to confirm that 100% (including all reported categories and unknown) was coming from the Total (Confirmed + Probable).</p>
<p>The way the site is currently set up, the numbers displayed on the donut charts rounds to the nearest hundred for any value over 1,000, meaning that we either need to use the percentages or the rounded values, leading to a loss of information in either case. Would it be possible to have the hover display the full number?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>Under race and ethnicity, that is correct for the first one.</p>
<p>On the second, we are not planning to change that one. The rounding keeps the hover-over figure shorter and makes the page easier to navigate.</p>
<p>And on the last one, there are unknowns included in the non-Hispanic figure.</p>

    <h2>September 24, 2020</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We noticed that the antigen reporting PDF that used to be posted to healthy.arkansas.gov, and represented tests (as opposed to people on the dashboard) hasn't been posted for the past few days. Are there plans to re-release the data in this PDF again?</p>
<ul>
<li>The numbers for total people tested via antigen posted on the dashboard have been fluctuating a bit. For example, yesterday, the totals dropped from 10,427 antigen tests to 9,453 total antigen tests. In addition, on 9/20, the antigen test numbers dropped from 9,587 to 5,216 before rising to 10,101 on 9/21. We were wondering what the reason behind this fluctuation is?</li>

          <p>I’ve been looking into this today and have a little bit of information. The antigen spike and subsequent changes was due to some data that was added in one update and then mistakenly left out of the next and then fixed. We are still looking into our antigen numbers, though, and we may have some additional updates to them next week.</p>

          <p>AR just updated its hospitalization reporting as of Friday, 9/11. Previously, it wasn't bringing in all of the hospitalization information. Going forward as of Friday, it should all be accurate. For example, before, the press conferences were reporting 380 hospitalizations, but the dash was only reporting 318. This will not be fixed in historical data, but will be accurate from now on. (This is me, Kara, summing up what Gavin said and not a direct quote)</p>

    <h2>August 18, 2020</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>On your dashboard, you appear to sum cases and “negative tests” to get the “total tests reported” figure. We are curious about the unit of “negative tests”. In a previous email, you told us the negative number represents the number of specimens collected
Can you confirm that this means the number of individual samples testing negative with no deduplication of samples? If it does mean this, can you explain why you are getting totals by adding this number to your cases in a different unit? If it does not, how do you calculate negatives? Do you only count one negative result per individual per day, for example?</p>

    </div>
    
  
    <h2>August 18, 2020</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>If you are only counting one negative per day, your “total test reported” may fit our understandings of “testing encounters”, which can be defined as “the number of unique people who have been tested per day.” Under this metric, if a person is tested for COVID twice on separate days, that counts as two testing encounters; however, if the same person has two samples collected for testing on one day, then that only counts as one testing encounter. We permit counting cases only once for the first positive in testing encounters, although we prefer if subsequent positives are captured. Does your “total tests reported” data point sound like it might fit this description? If not, are you willing to or are you planning to release testing encounters? If so, will you be able to provide historical data consistently under an automation friendly form, like an ArcGIS or CKAN API or a direct download of CSV or JSON?</p>

        <div>
          <p>The difference in number is often unknown or missing information. We get much of the racial and ethnicity data from the interviews that the case investigators do, so there is a lag time between when the positive test/new case is reported and when the interview occurs. If there are a large number of new positives then the “missing” category will similarly increase until the interviews are done.</p>

          <p>We aren’t including antibody tests in our numbers. (Also, FYI: https://news.uams.edu/2020/06/25/uams-developed-high-accuracy-covid-19-antibody-testing-begins-in-arkansas/ - provided by Michelle Kitchens at ACHI, a healthcare policy organization in Arkansas.

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The Department of Health website shows both cumulative (&quot;ever&quot;) and current counts of hospitalizations and individuals on a ventilator. However, the nursing home data does not appear to be cumulative. Is it possible for the Department to share cumulative nursing home / long term care facility data?</p>
