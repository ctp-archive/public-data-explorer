    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div>
      Oregon reports long-term care data for Care Facilities, Senior Living Communities and Congregate Living Settings. Oregon provides facility-level data.

Oregon reports cumulate and outbreak cases and deaths at the facility-level. An outbreak is defined by three or more confirmed COVID-19 cases or one or more deaths. Outbreaks are considered resolved if there are no new cases identified for 28 days after the last case onset. Resolved outbreak totals are added to current outbreak totals to get cumulative data. Total case count includes all cases associated with the outbreak (e.g., staff, residents, close contacts).  

Oregon reports the number of nursing home and assisted living facilities with an active case. These are categorized as outbreak facilities. Oregon defines a facility as an outbreak until 14 days have passed without any residents showing symptoms of the virus.

Oregon Health Authority reports on the number of facilities with five or fewer beds that have “three or more confirmed COVID-19 cases or one or deaths.” In each data collection, we added the number of those facilities, 3 cases and 1 death. This represents the minimum number of cases and deaths we can confirm to be true from the description provided by OR.        

June 17, 2020: Oregon started reporting resolved outbreaks 

June 18, 2020: CTP started reporting cumulative totals for Oregon

September 9, 2020: Oregon changed it&#39;s cumulative reporting to only include facilities within the last 56 days, noting: &quot;Facilities will be removed from the closed outbreak list after 56 days.&quot;
