    <div>
      <p>On the Overview page of the New Mexico COVID-19 dashboard, you report “Total # of Tests Performed,” and on the NMDOH COVID-19 info page you say “numbers are cumulative persons tested.” Can you please clarify what “Total # of Tests Performed” refers to? Does it refer to the number of unique people tested or the number of specimens tested overall? If “Total # of Tests Performed” refers to total individuals tested, do you have plans to release the total number of specimens tested? If “Total # of Tests Performed” refers to total specimens tested, do you have plans to release the number of total individuals tested?</p>

        <div>
          <p>At the beginning of testing in New Mexico, we reported on number of persons tested. This was the Governor’s office request for testing all New Mexicans. This wasn’t a problem because tests were so sparse most people were tested once, unless positive. We only count positives the first time because of circulating bits of RNA which is no longer infectious after 10 days of infection. On 5/13 we changed to reporting all tests done daily including positive repeats to better measure resources used. The info page is not reflective of the testing to date. They are the total # of tests not persons tested. We are working to correct that information. There is a discussion of what to report going forward on the info page and dashboard. We can provide information on total tests and total persons tested.</p>

    <h2>September 21, 2020</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Do you perform any deduplication to reach the “total tests” figure? If so, how? (i.e. instances swabbed, day, week, or recording only one positive test per person, but multiple negative tests for the same person)?
If the same person gets different tests results on different days, would you report the raw results as part of the daily positives or do you apply any kind of logic such as reporting only the first negative or positive result per individual?
We’re interested in testing data in units of “testing encounters,” which can be defined as “the number of people who have been tested per day.” Under this metric, if a person is being tested once today and once again the following week, that counts as two tests, however, if the same person has two samples collected at a testing center visit, then that only counts as one testing encounter. Might New Mexico be willing to release testing encounters? If so, will you be able to provide historical data consistently in a machine readable format?</p>

        <div>
          <p>We will count all testing per day, whether they have been tested in the past. Deduplication is done for all test results by counting only one record for person id and collection date. Because New Mexico is a dual reporting state both the lab and testing site (e.g. hospital, physician, etc) need to report the same test. Deduplication of the event is necessary to count only one test per person per day.</p>

          <p>It’s stronger than ever. Hospitals report all the additional required info to us, rather than report separately to HHS which was actually part of the initial plan.

    </div>
