    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <div>
      <p>As of February 13, 2021, Wyoming does not update their COVID-19 data on Saturdays. Beginning on March 7, 2021, they no longer update their COVID-19 data on Saturdays or Sundays.</p>
<p>Wyoming’s metrics do not update every day, and don’t always update together. As a result, please exercise extra caution when using numbers that are calculated from daily changes, especially if these calculations use multiple metrics. If anomalies are observed, numbers from previous days will be carried over until corrections are made.</p>
<p>Wyoming reports the number of people <em>Ever hospitalized</em> with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/">Statistics page</a>. In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.</p>
<p>Negatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>
<p>On February 9, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) fell from 704,836 to 595,970. We carried the previous day’s number as we believed this may have been an error. On February 10, 2021, we learned that the decrease was &quot;Due to recent changes in reporting by commercial laboratories, some test results were being counted twice. Testing numbers have been corrected to reflect these changes therefore a decrease in the testing numbers will be observed for Non-WPHL labs. That decrease is attributed to the removal of duplicate tests being reported&quot;. As a result of this new information, we are backfilling our Total PCR tests (specimens) to reflect this new information and ensure that our data aligns as closely as possible with Wyoming's.</p>
<p>On February 7, 2021, Wyoming’s <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> decreased by 36 and <strong>Recovered</strong> decreased by 2 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On February 02, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by roughly 4,600 and their Total PCR tests (people) decreased by approximately 1,500 without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases, decreased by roughly 1,600.</p>
<p>On January 25, 2021, Wyoming’s <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by roughly 106k, and their <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> decreased by about 3.6k without explanation. Their <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong> did not reflect that decrease, so we did not update their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>, or <strong>Negative PCR tests (people)</strong>, which is calculated as <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> minus <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> on January 25, 2021 to ensure our data is as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>On January 12, 2021, Wyoming reported more new Confirmed cases than new Total PCR tests (people). As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed Cases decreased by 85.</p>
<p>On December 24, 2020, Wyoming announced on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 24, 2020 or December 25, 2020. On January 1, 2021, they noted that there would be no update to their data on January 1, 2021.We were able to update <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> from Wyoming's separate <a href="https://sites.google.com/wyo.gov/exec-covid19/hospital-resources">hospitalization source</a> on both days.</p>
<p>On December 2, 2020, Wyoming's cumulative <strong>Positive PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 2,000, <strong>Negative PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 13,000, and <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 11,000. The data for these metrics, obtained by downloading the Crosstab data on <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/">Wyoming's State and County Dashboards</a>, has been unreliable over the last week. Please use caution when using this data.</p>
<p>As of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On November 27, 2020, Wyoming’s <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 10,000 without explanation. We believed that this decrease may be an error, and did not update Wyoming’s <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, which come from the same source on November 27, 2020. On November 28, 2020, and November 29, 2020, we were unable to update Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens) because Wyoming only updates these metrics on Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Wyoming announced on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2020, we started collecting <em>Total PCR tests (specimens)</em> from the &quot;Wyoming Updates&quot; section of Wyoming's <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> and started collecting <strong>Positive tests PCR (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative tests PCR (specimens)</strong> from the values in the graph on the &quot;Laboratory Results by Date&quot; graph on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/">COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page</a>. At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.</p>
<p>On November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> increased by more than their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> without explanation. As a result, <strong>Negative PCR tests (people)</strong>, which are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Total PCR Tests (people)</strong> values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> as well as <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On April 28, 2020, we began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> together with <strong>confirmed cases</strong>.</p>
<p>During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its <strong>Recovered</strong> metrics.</p>
<p>During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.</p>

<p>Wyoming reports the number of people <em>Ever hospitalized</em> with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/">Statistics page</a>. In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.</p>
<p>Negatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>
<p>On February 9, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) fell from 704,836 to 595,970. We carried the previous day’s number as we believed this may have been an error. On February 10, 2021, we learned that the decrease was &quot;Due to recent changes in reporting by commercial laboratories, some test results were being counted twice. Testing numbers have been corrected to reflect these changes therefore a decrease in the testing numbers will be observed for Non-WPHL labs. That decrease is attributed to the removal of duplicate tests being reported&quot;. As a result of this new information, we are backfilling our Total PCR tests (specimens) to reflect this new information and ensure that our data aligns as closely as possible with Wyoming's.</p>
<p>On February 7, 2021, Wyoming’s <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> decreased by 36 and <strong>Recovered</strong> decreased by 2 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On February 02, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by roughly 4,600 and their Total PCR tests (people) decreased by approximately 1,500 without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases, decreased by roughly 1,600.</p>
<p>On January 25, 2021, Wyoming’s <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by roughly 106k, and their <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> decreased by about 3.6k without explanation. Their <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong> did not reflect that decrease, so we did not update their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>, or <strong>Negative PCR tests (people)</strong>, which is calculated as <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> minus <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> on January 25, 2021 to ensure our data is as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>On January 12, 2021, Wyoming reported more new Confirmed cases than new Total PCR tests (people). As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed Cases decreased by 85.</p>
<p>On December 24, 2020, Wyoming announced on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 24, 2020 or December 25, 2020.

<p>On December 2, 2020, Wyoming's cumulative <strong>Positive PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 2,000, <strong>Negative PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 13,000, and <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 11,000. The data for these metrics, obtained by downloading the Crosstab data on <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/">Wyoming's State and County Dashboards</a>, has been unreliable over the last week. Please use caution when using this data.</p>
<p>As of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On November 27, 2020, Wyoming’s <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 10,000 without explanation. We believed that this decrease may be an error, and did not update Wyoming’s <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, which come from the same source on November 27, 2020. On November 28, 2020, and November 29, 2020, we were unable to update Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens) because Wyoming only updates these metrics on Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Wyoming announced on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2020, we started collecting <em>Total PCR tests (specimens)</em> from the &quot;Wyoming Updates&quot; section of Wyoming's <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> and started collecting <strong>Positive tests PCR (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative tests PCR (specimens)</strong> from the values in the graph on the &quot;Laboratory Results by Date&quot; graph on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/">COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page</a>. At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.</p>
<p>On November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> increased by more than their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> without explanation. As a result, <strong>Negative PCR tests (people)</strong>, which are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Total PCR Tests (people)</strong> values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> as well as <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On April 28, 2020, we began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> together with <strong>confirmed cases</strong>.</p>
<p>During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its <strong>Recovered</strong> metrics.</p>
<p>During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.</p>

<p>Wyoming reports the number of people <em>Ever hospitalized</em> with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/">Statistics page</a>. In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.</p>
<p>Negatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>
<p>On February 7, 2021, Wyoming’s *Confirmed cases” decreased by 36 and <strong>Recovered</strong> decreased by 2 with no explanation.</p>
<p>On February 02, 2021, Wyoming’s Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by roughly 4,600 and their Total PCR tests (people) decreased by approximately 1,500 without explanation. As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases, decreased by roughly 1,600.</p>
<p>On January 25, 2021, Wyoming’s <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by roughly 106k, and their <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> decreased by about 3.6k without explanation. Their <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong> did not reflect that decrease, so we did not update their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>, or <strong>Negative PCR tests (people)</strong>, which is calculated as <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> minus <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> on January 25, 2021 to ensure our data is as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>On January 12, 2021, Wyoming reported more new Confirmed cases than new Total PCR tests (people). As a result, Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed Cases decreased by 85.</p>
<p>On December 24, 2020, Wyoming announced on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 24, 2020 or December 25, 2020.

<p>On December 2, 2020, Wyoming's cumulative <strong>Positive PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 2,000, <strong>Negative PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 13,000, and <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 11,000.

Please use caution when using this data.</p>
<p>As of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On November 27, 2020, Wyoming’s <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 10,000 without explanation. We believed that this decrease may be an error, and did not update Wyoming’s <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, which come from the same source on November 27, 2020. On November 28, 2020, and November 29, 2020, we were unable to update Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens) because Wyoming only updates these metrics on Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Wyoming announced on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2020, we started collecting <em>Total PCR tests (specimens)</em> from the &quot;Wyoming Updates&quot; section of Wyoming's <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> and started collecting <strong>Positive tests PCR (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative tests PCR (specimens)</strong> from the values in the graph on the &quot;Laboratory Results by Date&quot; graph on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/">COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page</a>. At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.</p>
<p>On November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> increased by more than their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> without explanation. As a result, <strong>Negative PCR tests (people)</strong>, which are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Total PCR Tests (people)</strong> values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> as well as <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On April 28, 2020, we began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> together with <strong>confirmed cases</strong>.</p>
<p>During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its <strong>Recovered</strong> metrics.</p>
<p>During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.</p>

<p>Wyoming reports the number of people <em>Ever hospitalized</em> with COVID-19 as a percentage of “Lab Confirmed Cases by Reported Hospitalization” on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-map-and-statistics/">Statistics page</a>. In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.</p>
<p>Negatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>
<p>On December 2, 2020, Wyoming's cumulative <strong>Positive PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 2,000, <strong>Negative PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 13,000, and <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 11,000. The data for these metrics, obtained by downloading the Crosstab data on <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/">Wyoming's State and County Dashboards</a>, has been unreliable over the last week. Please use caution when using this data.</p>
<p>As of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On November 27, 2020, Wyoming’s <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased by about 10,000 without explanation. We believed that this decrease may be an error, and did not update Wyoming’s <strong>Positive PCR tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong>, which come from the same source on November 27, 2020. On November 28, 2020, and November 29, 2020, we were unable to update Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens) because Wyoming only updates these metrics on Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>On November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> increased by more than their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> without explanation. As a result, <strong>Negative PCR tests (people)</strong>, which are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Total PCR Tests (people)</strong> values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> as well as <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>

In the absence of a better data source we convert this percentage to an integer, and as a result of the calculation, this value may fluctuate.</p>
<p>Negatives reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>
<p>As of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On November 27, 2020, Wyoming’s Positive PCR tests (specimens) decreased by about 10,000 without explanation. We believed that this decrease may be an error, and did not update Wyoming’s Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens), which come from the same source on November 27, 2020. On November 28, 2020, and November 29, 2020, we were unable to update Positive PCR tests (specimens) and Negative PCR tests (specimens) because Wyoming only updates these metrics on Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>On November 26, 2020, Wyoming announced on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on November 26, 2020.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2020, we started collecting <em>Total PCR tests (specimens)</em> from the &quot;Wyoming Updates&quot; section of Wyoming's <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> and started collecting <em>Positive tests PCR (specimens)</em> and <em>Negative tests PCR (specimens)</em> from the values in the graph on the &quot;Laboratory Results by Date&quot; graph on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/">COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page</a>. At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.</p>
<p>On November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s Confirmed cases increased by more than their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> without explanation. As a result, <strong>Negative PCR tests (people)</strong>, which are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Total PCR Tests (people)</strong> values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.</p>
<p>On August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report <strong>Total PCR tests (people).</strong> We have carried over the previous day's value.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> as well as <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On April 28, 2020, we began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> together with <strong>confirmed cases</strong>.</p>
<p>During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its Recovered metrics.</p>
<p>During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.</p>

<p>As of November 25, 2020, Wyoming's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On November 25, 2020, we started collecting <em>Total PCR tests (specimens)</em> from the &quot;Wyoming Updates&quot; section of Wyoming's <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/">COVID-19 page</a> and started collecting <em>Positive tests PCR (specimens)</em> and <em>Negative tests PCR (specimens)</em> from the values in the graph on the &quot;Laboratory Results by Date&quot; graph on their <a href="https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/infectious-disease-epidemiology-unit/disease/novel-coronavirus/covid-19-state-and-county-dashboards/">COVID-19 State and County Dashboards page</a>. At the same time, we backfilled all three of the above time series based on the numbers from the second page, summing the positive and negative numbers to use for the historical totals.</p>
<p>On November 17, 2020, Wyoming’s Confirmed cases increased by more than their <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> without explanation. As a result, <strong>Negative PCR tests (people)</strong>, which are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> decreased.</p>
<p>On October 14, 2020, Wyoming's <strong>Total PCR Tests (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Total PCR Tests (people)</strong> values both decreased by over 1000 with no explanation. We believe the state might have deduplicated its data.</p>
<p>On August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report <strong>Total PCR tests (people).</strong> We have carried over the previous day's value.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> as well as <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On April 28, 2020, we began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> together with <strong>confirmed cases</strong>.</p>
<p>On April 22, 2020, Wyoming revised its <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> downward, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the calculated value of <strong>Negative PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>During the week of April 7, 2020, Wyoming began to report both confirmed and probable cases in its Recovered metrics.</p>
<p>During the week of April 6, 2020, Wyoming began reporting confirmed and probable cases separately.</p>

<p>On April 28, 2020, we began to report <strong>probable cases</strong> together with <strong>confirmed cases</strong>.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2020, Wyoming began reporting the <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> as well as <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong>.</p>
<p>On August 26, 2020, Wyoming did not report <em>Total PCR tests (people).</em>* We have carried over the previous day's value.</p>
<p>Wyoming reports both <strong>Positive tests PCR (specimens)</strong> and <strong>Negative tests PCR (specimens)</strong> as percentages of <strong>Total tests PCR</strong>. We convert these percentages to integers. Wyoming reports the number of people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 in each hospital: we sum these values for the state total. Wyoming reports the number of people ever hospitalized with COVID-19 as a percentage: we convert this percentage to an integer. Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>

The week of April 6, WY began separating confirmed &amp; suspected cases; we now report only confirmed. From April 7 to April 13, our recovered count may be slightly high, as WY combined recovered confirmed cases + recovered probable cases. On April 22, total tests were revised down, resulting in a decrease in negatives. As of April 28, we are including the suspected cases with the confirmed cases.
As of May 16, Wyoming is reporting specimens tested. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested</p>
