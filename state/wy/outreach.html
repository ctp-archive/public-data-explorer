          <p>Our standard definition for outbreak is three or more non-household contacts within an incubation period (14 days for COVID-19).For long-term care facilities, once case leads to increased testing and prevention measures. We consider outbreaks resolved after three clear rounds of weekly testing.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Has WY now been classifying cases of two or more races as only the primary race  recently? If so, at what point did this classification change happen? Is it possible to break these categories out to include 'two or more' or 'multiple races' as a separate category in line with the census so that an accurate comparison to the overall population is possible?</p>

        <div>
          <p>I’m told we've always classified race as “check all that apply,” meaning we do not force into a single race category and count cases in each race/ethnicity they identify as. We have not changed the way this is pulled since the pandemic’s beginning. At some point we may make a change but have no current plans to do so. [I asked a follow up as well because this didn't seem to answer the initial question: I think there's some confusion here between how WY collects race/ethnicity data - which may well for &quot;check all that apply&quot; and the way that data is classified in WY's public data dashboard - if someone DOES check more than one box for race, would their case be counted multiple times toward every category they checked? If not, how does the state determine where to classify a case and/or fatality of someone who checked multiple boxes?]</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We’re interested in testing data in units of “testing encounters,” which can be defined as “the number of people who have been tested per day.” Under this metric, if a person is being tested once today and once again the following week, that counts as two tests, however, if the same person has two samples collected at a testing center visit, then that only counts as one testing encounter. Might Wyoming be willing to release testing encounters numbers again ideally in an automation-friendly format?</p>

        <div>
          <p>Wyoming does report race and ethnicity data for COVID-19 deaths when it is available. It is included on the Case Map and Statistics Dashboard under &quot;COVID-19 Related Death Information&quot;. The Wyoming Department of Health, similar to other public health entities, faces challenges in collecting and publishing race and ethnicity information. Some of those challenges include:
-The way data is collected: the primary way to collect this information is self-report, or how people view themselves. Some people may be reluctant to share this information, or a person may be unavailable to ask this information.
-Small sample size: Wyoming has a relatively small population. Often we cannot produce reliable estimates for some racial or ethnic groups due to small sample sizes. Additionally in some locations racial and ethnic information may be personally identifying and we have policies in place that help protect the personal health information of Wyoming residents.
-Contributing factors: It is important to understand that racial and ethnic information is only one piece of the story. Health data about race, culture, or income can mean more about the community where a person lives, works, or plays than the choices a person makes. For example, differences in access to healthcare can have a bigger impact on health than the choices a person makes.</p>

          <p>On further analysis of our testing data we identified that some hospitals and reference laboratories were reporting duplicate results (multiple of the same results from the same patient from the same day). The decreased numbers reflect our removal of duplicate results, we felt it was important to post the more accurate data.</p>
