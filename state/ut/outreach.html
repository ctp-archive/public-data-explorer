          <p>We do not currently have this capability. We are collecting data from LTCFs via self-report surveys. Only about 50% of the facilities that have conducted clinics are currently reporting. We are working to increase that number and also hope to get this information added to the dashboard, we're just not there yet.</p>

          <p>Re: putting a breakdown of the total tests by test type on the dashboard, I brought it up with our surveillance team and it's something we'll look into.

          <p>No worries, this works too. Using the CSV you referenced in your original email (Overview_Total Tests by Date_2020-10-30.csv, for example) is the correct way to get both the total number of tests overall as well as the breakdown by type (PCR &amp; antigen). In fact, to get the number of total tests in the box at the top of the, we're summing the &quot;Count&quot; variable from the same data set that is used to create the above CSV. To get total numbers of tests by PCR or antigen, filter that same CSV by &quot;Test Type&quot; as appropriate (which is what you're doing by the sound of it).</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>There are 2 files: 'Overview_Number of People Tested by Date_2020-09-30.csv' 'Overview_Total Tests by Date_2020-09-30.csv' One makes it sound like it's specimens, and the other makes it sound like it's people, but the values in both files are the same. Is it expected? can they describe each file? The counts they have in the files do not exactly match the dashboard. Today the numbers match but yesterday they didnt. It's hard to make conclusions from 2 days, but I'd want to know whether the zip should always reflect the dashboard exactly?</p>

          <p>On the other two files, I'm not seeing the same thing you're seeing. The values in each file are different. They may be the same in the earlier days of the outbreak (as it was less likely people would be tested multiple times until later into the outbreak), but as I scroll down through the file the values are definitely different. Maybe there was a problem with the file on 9/30, but yes, the charts should reflect the dashboard.Will get back to you when I hear about the hospitalizations.</p>

      <p>We’re also interested in testing data in units of “testing encounters”, which can be defined as “the number of unique people who have been tested per day.“ Under this metric, if a person is being tested once today and once again the following week, that counts as two tests, however, if the same person has two samples tested at a testing center visit, then that only counts as one testing encounter. Are you willing to or are you planning to release testing encounters? If so, will you be able to provide historical data consistently under a machine readable format, like an ArcGIS or CKAN API or a direct download of CSV or JSON?</p>

          <p>Yes, we are tracking and reporting antigen tests. The number of positive and negative antigen tests can be found at https://coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts/ in the graph titled, &quot;Number of people tested&quot; on the Overview tab. You can click on the key to see the data points. They are very tiny to see, but if you hover over them, a little box will pop up that has the number by day. Because an antigen test is accurate in detecting active infection and which we use to make decisions like isolation or quarantine, we do include antigen test results in our total tests at the top of the overview tab.</p>

          <p>We have no plans currently to do this. If you would like a raw data file, you'll need to file a request with our office so we can filter it to our data teams. Please know that we are several weeks out with any data requests due to the large volumne of these we get each day.</p>

          <p>If a facility has gone 14 days without a new positive case we consider the outbreak in the facility to be resolved.</p>

        <div>
          <p>On the new data element, shooting for later this week. There are still some age categories and race/ethnicity categories where the numbers of deaths are too small to report, so trying to determine how best to address that. We are also looking at adding some rolling, 7-day graphs looking at percent positive of total daily tests.</p>

          <p>The race/ethnicity groups are not mutually exclusive, and allow for reporting race in combination or alone. These data have been cleaned prior to posting, and we will not remove a race or ethnicity if somebody reports in more than one category.</p>

          <p>Looking like it will probably be Thursday of this week. We will have case rates by small area, data on co-morbidities of cases and hospitalized cases, some new epi/incidence curves, cumulative information on ICU admits and ventilator use.</p>
