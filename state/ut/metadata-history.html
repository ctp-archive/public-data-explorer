    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <div>
      <p>On March 4, 2021, and March 5, 2021 Utah did not update their COVID-19 dashboards by the time of our daily update. As a result, we were unable to update their Cases (confirmed + probable) and hospitalization and death data. We will backfill the missing data as soon as it has been reviewed.</p>
<p>On February 12, 2021, we cleared the history of Utah's <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> field, which we previously filled using data from its positive people tested via PCR number. Utah does not present this figure as confirmed cases and instead calls its main case number, which includes both PCR and antigen tests, &quot;lab-confirmed cases.&quot; We did not duplicate Utah's main case number into Confirmed cases to replace this positive PCR individuals number because the definition the state uses for &quot;confirmed&quot; is not in accordance with CSTE definitions.</p>

      <p>On November 6, 2020, we switched our source for Utah’s Total PCR tests (people) to avoid reporting a mixed antigen and pcr test number. As a result Total PCR tests (people) and Negative PCR tests (people), which was previously calculated by subtracting Positive PCR tests (people) from Total PCR tests (people), decreased.</p>
<p>As of October 28, 2020, our Total Tests (PCR) and Positive Tests (PCR) for Utah are derived from the data download available on the Utah dashboard, which separates PCR and antigen tests.

      <p>Utah combines PCR and antigen tests in the top-line total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard. The state does provide antigen and PCR tests results in a stacked bar chart on the dashboard, but the numbers can only be obtained by rolling over tiny targets on the provided bars, making them very difficult to record and verify. We have requested complete historical antigen and PCR testing data from the state.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    <div>
      <p>Utah combines PCR and antigen tests in the top-line total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard. The state does provide antigen and PCR tests results in a stacked bar chart on the dashboard, but the numbers can only be obtained by rolling over tiny targets on the provided bars, making them very difficult to record and verify. We have requested complete historical antigen and PCR testing data from the state.</p>
<p>As of June 11, 2020, Utah reports a combined case count for total intubated patients and patients on a ventilator. We report this figure as <strong>Ever on ventilator</strong>.</p>
<p>As of July 16, 2020, Utah is reporting both specimens and people tested. We report positives and negatives based on the number of people tested.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong>.</p>
