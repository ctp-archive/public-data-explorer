    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Until now, AZ deduplicates to unique individuals by test type (e.g. counted once for serology, once for PCR), so that the PCR-only number reflected unique individuals.  But now, AZ has changed its PCR-only number to  reflect “diagnostic” testing which is defined as PCR and antigen. Does that mean that individuals are being double-counted in that figure if they tested on PCR and antigen? Or has the deduplication policy changed to support the launch of that new statistic?</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>

        </p>
        <div>
          <p>Percent positivity is calculated from the total number of individuals who test positive divided by the total number of individuals tested by test type based on reporting through Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR). The majority of reports of COVID-19 are received through ELR, but there are some laboratories that are currently only reporting positive individuals through fax and other mechanisms. These individuals will be included as cases, but will not be reflected in the percent positivity number. We are continuously working with labs to report through electronic means, but - for this reason - the percent positivity cannot be calculated as cases divided by tests.</p>
<p>There is also a hover function on the percent positive by week graph on the Laboratory Testing module of the dashboard. When you hover your mouse over individual fields, the total number of tests reported electronically is displayed, along with the total number of positive tests reported electronically. This provides additional clarity on how the percent positivity rates are calculated.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>09/04/20: On the ADHS COVID-19 Data Dashboard, your metric for total tests is “Total COVID-19 Tests” - can you clarify whether “Total COVID-19 PCR Tests” refers to specimens  Does cases count unique people  or unique individuals? Do you perform any de-duplication to reach the “Total COVID-19 Tests’“value? If so, how? (i.e. instances swabbed, day, week, or recording only one positive test per person, but multiple negative tests for the same person)? If the same person gets different test results on different days, would you report the raw results as part of the daily positives or do you apply any kind of logic such as reporting only the first negative or positive result per individual?</p>
<p>09/17/20: If an individual gets tested via a PCR test 3 times on different weeks, and the test result is negative each time, would the “Total COVID-19 PCR Tests” record this as 3 tests or 1 test?</p>

        <div>
          <p>On the ADHS COVID-19 Dashboard, &quot;cases&quot; represent unique individuals. Additionally, laboratory testing data is deduplicated by patient and test type. If someone continues to test positive, which we are aware that some people do, they are not being counted multiple times in either the case or the laboratory data.  A unique person will only appear one time by each test type. If someone is tested by PCR and then serology, they would appear once in each test type for percent positivity purposes.</p>

          <p>If the same person gets tested by PCR multiple times with the same result then it will only be counted once. As previously noted, Arizona's laboratory testing data is deduplicated by patient and test type.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Do you have plans to release the alternative to what you’re currently reporting (ie; If the metric refers to all tests/specimens, will you release the total number of individuals tested)?</p>
<p>Do you have plans to release a full historical time-series of all testing and results? Other states provide their COVID-19 testing and outcomes in machine readable format, but as far as we are aware ADHS does not at this time. Do you have plans to release all testing and results data in a machine readable format (i.e. csv or json)?</p>
<p>We are also interested in testing data in units of “testing encounters” which can be defined as “the number of people who have been tested per day.” Under this metric, if a person is being tested once today and once again the following week, that counts as two tests, however, if the same person has two samples collected at a testing center visit, then that only counts as one testing encounter. Are you willing to or are you planning to release testing encounters? If so, will you be able to provide historical data consistently under a machine readable format (i.e. csv or json)?</p>

        <div>
          <p>The vast majority of reports received by ADHS come in through Electronic Laboratory Reporting. Race/ethnicity should be reported by commercial laboratories if the information is available to them. Unfortunately, this data is not always available and may not be included in the initial reports received by the Department.
Executive Order 2020-48 requires hospitals to report individual patients hospitalized with COVID-19, including demographic information on race/ethnicity. We anticipate that this data may improve overall race/ethnicity data for hospitalized patients. The Department continues to evaluate additional ways to fill in race/ethnicity for non-hospitalized patients, including using the Health Information Exchange. Please note that these measures are not fully implemented at this time.</p>

          <p>Labs and healthcare providers report this data to us in the current format through their systems, so we are unable to further delineate race/ethnicity categories.</p>

          <p>All of the available data for COVID-19 can be found on our Data Dashboard at azhealth.gov/covid19. Currently, race and ethnicity data for Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander is housed under the same category, and we do not have the additional information necessary to further separate these groups.</p>

    <div>
      <p>5/30: Can Arizona specify which race categories they count under the grouping labeled &quot;Other, non-Hispanic?&quot;
8/5: Can Arizona specify which race categories they count under the grouping labeled &quot;Other, non-Hispanic?&quot; (It would be very helpful if you could provide information more specific /concrete than &quot;may include any race that is not specified by the other listed categories&quot;)</p>
