    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <div>
      Arizona reports long-term care data for Long-Term Care and Assisted Living Facilities. Arizona only reports cumulative numbers of facilities with cases of COVID-19. Data is updated daily.

Though Arizona does report some information about COVID-19 in congregate settings, the state does not provide specific numbers to help us understand how COVID-19 is spreading through the state&#39;s long-term-care facilities. For that reason, our long-term-care facility case and death information for Arizona comes from Maricopa County and Pima County

June 4, 2020: CTP began reporting Maricopa County and Pima County resident cases and deaths and staff cases and deaths due to Arizona not releasing any information other than the of number of facilities with a COVID-19 case. Maricopa and Pima County&#39;s totals include nursing homes, assisted living facilities and hospice care. CTP still only reports facility totals from the state.

July 9, 2020: Maricopa and Pima County did not update LTC data. Data was carried over from prior week.

July 23, 2020: Maricopa and Pima County did not update LTC data. Data was carried over from prior week.

August 10, 2020: Maricopa and Pima County did not update LTC data. Data was carried over from prior week.

December 24, 2020: Pima County has not updated since November 30. Carrying Pima&#39;s values from last release.

    <h3>Alerts</h3>
    <div>
      The only long-term-care data Arizona provides is the cumulative number of facilities that have ever had a COVID-19 case. This is not enough data to analyze. Due to the lack of substantial information coming from the state, case and death data represents Arizona’s largest county, Maricopa County and Pima County.
