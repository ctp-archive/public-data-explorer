    <h2>May 7, 2020, 2:02 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>While the increase was broad—10 states reported more than 10k tests—a few states reported unusually high numbers, suggesting they reported several days worth of negative tests today.</p>
<p>AZ, e.g., normally reports 3-4k tests. They reported 19k tests and fewer positives than normal.</p>

    <h2>May 8, 2020, 12:48 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Arizona is the first U.S. state to begin reporting serology tests. We've been anticipating this, so on the backend we're prepared to record these numbers.</p>
<p>We will publish the data as soon as we can work out the particular kinks of how to do so.</p>

<p>Not all states report this data, and we wish that they did. https://t.co/ql49O8FtuK</p>

    <div>
      <p>In addition to the states we've mentioned recently, Alabama, Arizona, California, and Wisconsin are worth keeping eyes on.</p>
<p>California and Arizona had new highs for cases today. Alabama and Wisconsin set highs yesterday. https://t.co/M2JTnIfchI</p>

      <p>This is what a &quot;patchwork pandemic&quot; (as @edyong209 called it) looks like.</p>
<p>The regions vary, as do the states. While New York is seeing its best days since the very beginning, Arizona is seeing its worst. https://t.co/KJf0Mn9S18</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 5, 2020, 3:35 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>Arizona cases and hospitalizations continue to move upward. The positive test rate is also increasing.</p>
<p>The same is true in South Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Kentucky. https://t.co/7PcHgg1gvW</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 7, 2020, 3:35 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Only 20k new cases were reported today. 24 states reported more than 300 new cases today.</p>
<p>New York and New Jersey tested more than 102k people combined, and only got ~1k positives.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Arizona tested ~10k people and confirmed 1,438 new cases. https://t.co/q7b8gj50V2</p>

    <h2>June 9, 2020, 3:02 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>States reported over 23k new cases today. That's within the range we've seen over the last month.</p>
<p>Here are the states that reported over 400 new cases. Arkansas, Arizona, and North Carolina reported new one-day highs. https://t.co/UeFFtjzdwB</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 12, 2020, 3:23 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Here are four states—Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, and Arkansas—that had worrisome numbers today.</p>
<p>(Arizona's data dashboard crashed today, so we don't have a full set of their numbers. But we were able to capture these two metrics.) https://t.co/NDEfzp9cjn</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 13, 2020, 2:55 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We are seeing new hospitalization highs in Texas, Arizona, and North Carolina. We're showing Louisiana here as well for context, since it had an early COVID-19 outbreak. https://t.co/BvbW8DYEyt</p>

    <h2>June 17, 2020, 3:15 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The northeast has bottomed out, while the south and west are growing.</p>
<p>For the last two days, the state of Arizona alone has reported more new cases than the whole northeast. This was unimaginable even a few weeks ago. https://t.co/zkqM3oExGh</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 17, 2020, 3:21 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Hospitalizations reflect the same trends. Arizona now has more people hospitalized than NY.</p>
<p>(Note: Florida might be on the right-hand list, but it does not provide this metric.) https://t.co/6iAzGanQ6J</p>

    <div>
      <p>Here are 5 states we looked at closely today.</p>
<p>Cases and hospitalizations are tracking closely in TX, AZ, and the Carolinas, but not in California. California's positive rate also has not gone up. https://t.co/xqOUjRWpbo</p>

      <p>Arizona reported a record number of cases and current hospitalizations today.</p>
<p>The signal is not entirely clear yet—and the absolute numbers are small—but deaths in the state have been generally rising since May 27. https://t.co/zfhgPcHW97</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 24, 2020, 4:02 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Here's the continuing best news: deaths have not turned upward.</p>
<p>And the death numbers today and yesterday have been too high as they reflect Delaware (yesterday) and Arizona (today) rectifying undercounting of COVID-19 deaths from previous days. https://t.co/lvzuaLEs18</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 28, 2020, 4:33 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Our apologies. The first Arizona chart we posted had a problem. The average deaths have risen, but not by as much as the chart showed. We've deleted the previous chart. This one is correct.</p>
<p>We regret the error. https://t.co/zeAoYcHrsO</p>

    <div>
      <p>States reported ~36k new cases today. States typically report the fewest cases on Mondays (red in the chart) because of a weekend lag effect.</p>
<p>For example, Arizona reported 600 cases today after four straight days over 3000 cases. https://t.co/PUMWCzmlnI</p>

      <p>While we’re in the Monday lull in data reporting, let’s look at a couple of concerning states outside AZ-CA-FL-TX outbreaks.</p>
<p>Missouri’s percent positive rate has gone from 4.3% the week of June 14 to 6.5% this week, with hospitalizations rising. https://t.co/ahvI7Gdn7W</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 30, 2020, 3:30 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas are still at the center of the current surge of new cases. Hospitalization for AZ, CA, and TX all climbing. We expect Florida's data has a similar shape. https://t.co/8G9RRQta6j</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 30, 2020, 3:42 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Arizona’s update catches some reporting backlog — a common Tuesday data effect across many states. The 7-day average is often more useful to watch.</p>
<p>What's clear: The state’s surge has swamped local testing capacity. This week, almost a quarter of tests have come back positive. https://t.co/cdft4OzS4E</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 30, 2020, 4:06 PM PDT</h2>

<p>Deaths are not falling everywhere. In Arizona, for example, daily average deaths have tripled since June. https://t.co/8VQEnFCUKR</p>

    <h2>July 2, 2020, 3:13 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>It should be obvious now, but the large numbers of new cases in these states are not just due to testing. Florida and Georgia have positivity rates well beyond 10%.</p>
<p>Only Arizona has a higher positivity rate than Florida right now. https://t.co/ovxcUPtGpp</p>

      <p>There’s been a lot of discussions about deaths continuing to trend down as cases have surged. This chart provides a partial answer to what’s been happening. The falling numbers in the NE were offsetting rising deaths in AZ, TX, FL. https://t.co/hmZkhZXTPS</p>

      <p>Sadly, cases are rising in many states beyond Florida, Texas, and Arizona. 23 states have seen their highest day of cases in the past 2 weeks. https://t.co/C5SC2UYLjg</p>

    <div>
      <p>Although new cases continue to grow, testing providers are being overwhelmed. Turnaround times are lengthening; the supply chain is stressed. In a place like Arizona, this may mean that we won’t see rapid increases in cases because testing cannot scale with the outbreak. https://t.co/lTMW1VLGWe</p>

      <p>Arizona is the poster child for this problem. Even as the outbreak continues there and hospitalizations and deaths rise, the 7-day average for tests has fallen in July. https://t.co/kYRQ2WgObb</p>

      <p>Florida didn't just break the record for reported cases. It also shattered the mark for cases per million population. New York, at peak, hit 595. Today, Florida reported 712 cases per million. Arkansas also entered the 500+ tier, where we've only seen FL, AZ, and LA. https://t.co/KeQmHMA9as</p>

      <p>Arizona’s data is muddled. Testing capacity is maxed, which affects the case count, as you can see by the similarity in the shape of those charts. But looking at other metrics, today the state reported record hospitalizations and its 2nd-highest number of deaths. https://t.co/b6DHtPoF0p</p>

      <p>Arizona and Missouri report only facilities with outbreaks, not actual cases, deaths, or facility names—this appears transparent, but doesn’t convey COVID-19’s true impact. County health depts (Maricopa, AZ and St. Louis, MO) provide both states’ most reliable source of LTC data.</p>
