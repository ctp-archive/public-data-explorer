      <p>Arizona combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state’s dashboard</p>
<p>Arizona regularly reviews and removes duplicate records which may occasionally result in minor decreases of cumulative figures.</p>
<p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for Arizona reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>On March 1, 2021, Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1366405875754291212?s=20">announced</a> via the official Arizona Department of Health Twitter that due to death certificate matching, Confirmed deaths increased by 1, and Probable deaths decreased by 2. As a result, Deaths (confirmed + probable) decreased by 1.</p>
<p>On February 22, 2021, Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1363869914356994054?s=20">announced</a> via the Department of Health's official Twitter that no new deaths were reported. Additionally, there was a decrease of 3 deaths (confirmed and probable) due to death certificate matching.</p>
<p>On January 18, 2021 Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1351183189100867586">announced</a> via the official Arizona Department of Health twitter that their reported Deaths (confirmed and probable) decreased by one due to de-duplication of the data.</p>
<p>On January 9, 2021, Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1347930259170021376?s=20">announced</a> that the number of COVID-19 patients in ICU was incomplete on their COVID-19 dashboard, and we sourced Currently in ICU from the official Arizona Department of Health twitter.</p>
<p>On December 28, 2020, Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1343575976026886144">noted</a> that due to the holiday weekend, multiple days of case reviews were completed, resulting in the data for December 28, 2020 being higher than usual. As a result, they reported a larger increase in Confirmed cases than Total PCR tests (people), which caused their Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases, to decrease.</p>
<p>As of December 10, 2020, Arizona's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative. We backfilled the data for March 2 2020 through December 8 2020 using the time-series posted on Arizona's dashboard as <a href="https://tableau.azdhs.gov/views/ELRv2testlevelandpeopletested/TestsConducted?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:embed=y">Diagnostic Tests Conducted</a>.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2020, Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1333791978992017408">announced</a> that figures reported on December 1, 2020, would be higher than normal due to a delay in case review and reported over the Thanksgiving weekend.</p>
<p>On October 6, 2020, the Arizona Department of Health Services <a href="https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/covid-19-hospitalizations-in-arizona/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=AZDHS&amp;utm_campaign=covid19,Director%27s+Blog&amp;utm_content=3840149936&amp;linkId=101333440">announced</a> that they were removing cases who had been admitted to a hospital but had not been hospitalized from their total hospitalization counts. This results in a decrease of Arizona's cumulative hospitalizations.</p>
<p>On September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed.</p>
<p>On September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.</p>
<p>From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for <strong>Cases</strong> and <strong>Deaths</strong>, so we could not update <strong>Confirmed Cases,</strong> <strong>Probable Cases,</strong> <strong>Confirmed Deaths,</strong> or <strong>Probable Deaths</strong> during this period. We were still able to update the total data points for <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (confirmed plus probable)</strong>. We will backfill the separate confirmed and probable case and death data if Arizona provides historical numbers.</p>
<p>On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for <strong>Cumulative hospitalized</strong> to match Arizona's dashboard data for &quot;hospitalized by date admitted.&quot; Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.</p>

      <p>Arizona combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state’s dashboard</p>
<p>Arizona regularly reviews and removes duplicate records which may occasionally result in minor decreases of cumulative figures.</p>
<p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for Arizona reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Confirmed cases</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (people)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>On January 9, 2021, Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1347930259170021376?s=20">announced</a> that the number of COVID-19 patients in ICU was incomplete on their COVID-19 dashboard, and we sourced Currently in ICU from the official Arizona Department of Health twitter.</p>
<p>On December 28, 2020, Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1343575976026886144">noted</a> that due to the holiday weekend, multiple days of case reviews were completed, resulting in the data for December 28, 2020 being higher than usual. As a result, they reported a larger increase in Confirmed cases than Total PCR tests (people), which caused their Negative PCR tests (people), which is calculated as Total PCR tests (people) minus Confirmed cases, to decrease.</p>
<p>As of December 10, 2020, Arizona's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative. We backfilled the data for March 2 2020 through December 8 2020 using the time-series posted on Arizona's dashboard as <a href="https://tableau.azdhs.gov/views/ELRv2testlevelandpeopletested/TestsConducted?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:embed=y">Diagnostic Tests Conducted</a>.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2020, Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1333791978992017408">announced</a> that figures reported on December 1, 2020, would be higher than normal due to a delay in case review and reported over the Thanksgiving weekend.</p>
<p>On October 6, 2020, the Arizona Department of Health Services <a href="https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/covid-19-hospitalizations-in-arizona/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=AZDHS&amp;utm_campaign=covid19,Director%27s+Blog&amp;utm_content=3840149936&amp;linkId=101333440">announced</a> that they were removing cases who had been admitted to a hospital but had not been hospitalized from their total hospitalization counts. This results in a decrease of Arizona's cumulative hospitalizations.</p>
<p>On September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed.</p>
<p>On September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.</p>
<p>From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for <strong>Cases</strong> and <strong>Deaths</strong>, so we could not update <strong>Confirmed Cases,</strong> <strong>Probable Cases,</strong> <strong>Confirmed Deaths,</strong> or <strong>Probable Deaths</strong> during this period. We were still able to update the total data points for <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (confirmed plus probable)</strong>. We will backfill the separate confirmed and probable case and death data if Arizona provides historical numbers.</p>
<p>On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for <strong>Cumulative hospitalized</strong> to match Arizona's dashboard data for &quot;hospitalized by date admitted.&quot; Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.</p>

      <p>Arizona combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state’s dashboard</p>
<p>Arizona regularly reviews and removes duplicate records which may occasionally result in minor decreases of cumulative figures.</p>
<p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for Arizona reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>
<p>As of December 10, 2020, Arizona's total test results are drawn from our <code>totalTestsViral</code> field instead of calculated via positive+negative. We backfilled the data for March 2 2020 through December 8 2020 using the time-series posted on Arizona's dashboard as <a href="https://tableau.azdhs.gov/views/ELRv2testlevelandpeopletested/TestsConducted?:isGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&amp;:embed=y">Diagnostic Tests Conducted</a>.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2020, Arizona <a href="https://twitter.com/AZDHS/status/1333791978992017408">announced</a> that figures reported on December 1, 2020, would be higher than normal due to a delay in case review and reported over the Thanksgiving weekend.</p>
<p>On October 6, 2020, the Arizona Department of Health Services <a href="https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/covid-19-hospitalizations-in-arizona/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=AZDHS&amp;utm_campaign=covid19,Director%27s+Blog&amp;utm_content=3840149936&amp;linkId=101333440">announced</a> that they were removing cases who had been admitted to a hospital but had not been hospitalized from their total hospitalization counts. This results in a decrease of Arizona's cumulative hospitalizations.</p>
<p>On September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed.</p>
<p>On September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.</p>
<p>From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for <strong>Cases</strong> and <strong>Deaths</strong>, so we could not update <strong>Confirmed Cases,</strong> <strong>Probable Cases,</strong> <strong>Confirmed Deaths,</strong> or <strong>Probable Deaths</strong> during this period. We were still able to update the total data points for <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (confirmed plus probable)</strong>. We will backfill the separate confirmed and probable case and death data if Arizona provides historical numbers.</p>
<p>On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for <strong>Cumulative hospitalized</strong> to match Arizona's dashboard data for &quot;hospitalized by date admitted.&quot; Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.</p>

<p>On October 6, 2020, The Arizona Department of Health Services <a href="https://directorsblog.health.azdhs.gov/covid-19-hospitalizations-in-arizona/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=AZDHS&amp;utm_campaign=covid19,Director%27s+Blog&amp;utm_content=3840149936&amp;linkId=101333440">announced</a> that they were removing cases who had been admitted to a hospital but had not been hospitalized from their total hospitalization counts. This results in a decrease of Arizona's cumulative hospitalizations.</p>
<p>As of September 25, 2020, Arizona’s total test timeseries is stored in our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of Total PCR Tests (specimens), reflecting a response to our outreach to Arizona’s health department that it counts unique individuals tested. Arizona includes antigen tests in its totals figure, so if an individual received both an antigen and PCR test, they are counted only once. Additionally, as of September 25, 2020,  Arizona's total test results are drawn from our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>
<p>On September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed.</p>
<p>On September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.</p>
<p>From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for <strong>Cases</strong> and <strong>Deaths</strong>, so we could not update <strong>Confirmed Cases,</strong> <strong>Probable Cases,</strong> <strong>Confirmed Deaths,</strong> or <strong>Probable Deaths</strong> during this period. We were still able to update the total data points for <strong>Cases (confirmed plus probable)</strong> and <strong>Deaths (confirmed plus probable)</strong>. We will backfill this data if Arizona provides historical numbers.</p>
<p>On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for <strong>Cumulative hospitalized</strong> to match Arizona's dashboard data for &quot;hospitalized by date admitted.&quot; Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.</p>

      <p>Arizona combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state’s dashboard</p>
<p>On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for <strong>Cumulative hospitalized</strong> to match Arizona's dashboard data for &quot;hospitalized by date admitted.&quot; Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.</p>
<p>From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for <strong>cases</strong> and <strong>deaths</strong>. We will backfill this data if Arizona provides historical numbers.</p>
<p>On July 28 and July 29, 2020, we noticed that Arizona's numbers for their <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> decreased slightly, while those for <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong> increased significantly. The state offered no explanation.</p>
<p>On August 30 and August 31, the Arizona Department of Health removed duplicate case records from their data. As a result, total deaths decreased by 1 on August 31, and cumulative hospitalizations decreased on August 30 and August 31.</p>
<p>On September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.</p>
<p>On September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed</p>
<p>As of September 25, 2020, Arizona’s total test timeseries is stored in our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of Total PCR Tests (specimens), reflecting a response to our outreach to Arizona’s health department that it counts unique individuals tested.

      <p>Arizona combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state’s dashboard</p>
<p>On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for <strong>Cumulative hospitalized</strong> to match Arizona's dashboard data for &quot;hospitalized by date admitted.&quot; Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.</p>
<p>From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for <strong>cases</strong> and <strong>deaths</strong>. We will backfill this data if Arizona provides historical numbers.</p>
<p>On July 28 and July 29, 2020, we noticed that Arizona's numbers for their <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> decreased slightly, while those for <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong> increased significantly. The state offered no explanation.</p>
<p>On August 30 and August 31, the Arizona Department of Health removed duplicate case records from their data. As a result, total deaths decreased by 1 on August 31, and cumulative hospitalizations decreased on August 30 and August 31.</p>
<p>On September 16, 2020, Arizona added antigen testing into its main totals figure. This appears to have raised its Total Tests (PCR) number more than usual.</p>
<p>On September 18, 2020, Arizona reported a policy change in the way they count people with positive antigen testing results to comply with CSTE case definitions. This appears to have resulted in a large increase in probable cases and also likely the reason where a decrease in confirmed cases was observed</p>
<p>As of September 25, 2020, Arizona’s total test timeseries is stored in our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of Total PCR Tests (specimens), reflecting a response to our outreach to Arizona’s health department that it counts unique individuals tested. Arizona includes antigen tests in its totals figure, so if an individual received both an antigen and PCR test, they are counted only once. Additionally, as of September 25, 2020,  Arizona's total test results are drawn from our Total PCR Tests (People) field instead of calculated via positive+negative.</p>

      <p>On June 23, 2020, we updated our historical data for <strong>Cumulative hospitalized</strong> to match Arizona's dashboard data for &quot;hospitalized by date admitted.&quot; Data for this metric is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates will continue to compile Arizona’s overall number as of cumulative hospitalizations, regardless of date admitted.</p>
<p>From July 18–August 5, 2020, Arizona’s dashboard stopped displaying confirmed and probable breakdowns for <strong>cases</strong> and <strong>deaths</strong>. We will backfill this data if Arizona provides historical numbers.</p>
<p>On July 28 and July 29, 2020, we noticed that Arizona's numbers for their <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> decreased slightly, while those for <strong>Ever hospitalized</strong> increased significantly. The state offered no explanation.</p>
<p>On August 30 and August 31, the Arizona Department of Health removed duplicate case records from their data. As a result, total deaths decreased by 1 on August 31, and cumulative hospitalizations decreased on August 30 and August 31.</p>
<p>Arizona regularly reviews and removes duplicate records which may occasionally result in minor decreases of cumulative figures.</p>
<p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for Arizona reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not comprehend the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Negative test results reported in our API and CSVs are calculated by subtracting <strong>Positive PCR tests (people)</strong> from <strong>Total PCR tests (specimens)</strong> in the absence of better data.</p>

      <p>Negative = Total - Positive.
As of May 8, Arizona is reporting specimens tested, including both PCR and antibody tests. Because some people may be tested more than once, this number is probably higher than the number of people tested.
On June 23, we updated our historical data for cumulative hospitalization to match AZ dashboard’s hospitalized by date admitted data. This data is not typically reported until several days after admittance. Our daily updates to this value going forward will continue to take AZ’s overall number as of that day, regardless of date admitted.
On July 18, AZ’s dashboard stopped displaying the confirmed vs. probable breakdown of cases and deaths with its hover-over feature. We are going to back-fill the breakdown once AZ provides the historical numbers.</p>
