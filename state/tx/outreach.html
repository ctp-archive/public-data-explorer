    <h2>April 1, 2021</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We notice that the number of positive antigen tests that TX reports is much lower than the number of probable cases. On March 22, for example, there were 379,471 probable cases vs. only 223,567 antigen positive tests.
In most other states reporting both figures using the most recent case definition as TX does, the values track very closely.
Why are TX’s antigen positive tests so much lower than its probable cases?</p>

        <div>
          <p>The definition of probable cases doesn’t require a person be tested if they meet clinical criteria and have an epidemiological link to a confirmed case. There are 57 local health departments and 8 regional health departments in Texas that investigate and report their cases to DSHS. The counts they provide are what is posted for probable cases on the DSHS dashboard.</p>

          <p>As the regulatory authority for long-term care facilities in Texas, our top priority is the health and safety of the people in these facilities. Our team is working hard to protect residents and staff in these facilities from COVID-19. The Texas Department of State Health Services is coordinating the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and we are supporting their efforts. Please contact Texas DSHS for information on vaccine distribution and vaccination rates. Texas HHSC recently established rules requiring nursing facilities and assisted living facilities to report vaccination data. We will be placing this self-reported information on the HHSC website and updating it daily. You can read the emergency rules here: <a href="https://hhs.texas.gov/about-hhs/communications-events/news/2021/01/hhsc-adopts-new-covid-19-vaccination-data-reporting-emergency-rules-nf-alf-providers">https://hhs.texas.gov/about-hhs/communications-events/news/2021/01/hhsc-adopts-new-covid-19-vaccination-data-reporting-emergency-rules-nf-alf-providers</a></p>

      <p>According to the notes on the &quot;Texas Tests by Type&quot; Dashboard, the data is &quot;totally deduplicated&quot; since that is the only way it can get passed the quality checks performed by the NEDSS. How should we interpret your data for individuals that are tested multiple times, for example those who test on a routine basis for their job?  Are your numbers in terms of:  instances swabbed per week, recording only the first positive per person?</p>

          <p>We are counting the number of tests by day and not the number of tests by person. So, if a person receives multiple tests (same type of test) on the same day with the same sample, then they will only be counted once. If they are getting tested daily (different collection dates, samples and tests), these tests are ALL getting counted. We are only removing the true duplicate reports. If they were tested by different types of tests on the same day, each test would be counted in its respective category.</p>

          <p>The biggest change is that US HHS was asking for more data fields to be reported, and in some cases we needed to update which fields we were pulling together ensure the data matches what we were reporting previously.</p>
<p>After the change, hospitals initially reported directly to HHS, but DSHS has again assumed reporting responsibility and is submitting data to the federal government on hospitals’ behalf. There hasn’t been a change in which hospitals are reporting (or should be).</p>

          <p>The bulk of the unknowns are from early in the crisis when they weren't collecting this. She says that data is lost forever; no way of going back to find out (may be worth following up in case they can be pressured reach back out to people? but sounded like a no anyway). She also said they have a 'prefer not to disclose' option and that those are categorized &quot;unknown.&quot;</p>
<p>She did give provide some additional data (percentages, unfortunately) as of today, June 8 2020, that may not be on the dashboard. These are for the 119 (as of today June 8) deaths in Harris County EXCLUDING city of Houston</p>
