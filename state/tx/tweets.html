      <p>New  update with state data up to midnight eastern: tally shows over 4000 tests.</p>
<p>https://t.co/Zc39AZVRge</p>
<p>WA and CA have conducted the most tests and have the most cases. Big gaps in our testing capacity knowledge: MA, TX, GA, PA.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 11, 2020, 12:53 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@adamwulf We’re largely following the state heath departments, though we have enriched with media reports, and probably will do so with TX if the state continues to update slowly. -@alexismadrigal</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 12, 2020, 10:01 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The current number of people tested is now up to almost 14,000. Still far, far too low.</p>
<p>GA, MA, TX remain data holes.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 13, 2020, 1:54 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>These numbers are a lower bound for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are still waiting on accurate negative test counts from CA, MA, GA, and TX, among other states.</li>
<li>Commercial labs only report positive results to the states.</li>
</ol>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 14, 2020, 1:50 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@joshtpm Washington and New York are driving the numbers. We're falling further behind on CA testing numbers. Now that MA is out in the open, the other big question mark is TX.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 17, 2020, 1:40 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>One positive development is that Texas, Massachusetts, and several other states have begun to include total testing numbers from <em>commercial</em> labs, which are coming online. TX, for example: https://t.co/motgizKtMQ</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 17, 2020, 1:49 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>And yet: we have known that our numbers were a lower bound on the number of tests for a while. We were just missing some total test numbers from big states. Now that some of those have been filled (thanks TX, MA!)—we have more data going uncaptured: private lab testing.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 17, 2020, 1:49 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Worse, we're not able to tell you what the scale of that problem is on a state-by-state or national level. In Texas, private labs are doing ~50% of the testing. In MA, it's less than 25%. In AK, it's closer to 10%.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 18, 2020, 2:22 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We want to thank some states for excellent new dashboards that now include all negative tests, including those from commercial laboratories. Thank you, @TexasDSHS, @GaDPH, @HealthyFla.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>March 18, 2020, 3:44 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>@doughardy_ct @TexasDSHS @GaDPH @HealthyFla Fantastic!</p>

    <h2>March 20, 2020, 1:45 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>For example, here is the page for Texas: https://t.co/Wq0UFOUPqh.</p>
<p>You can see on this page that Texas reported 2,922 new test results today, after having only performed 2,355 cumulative tests prior to today!</p>

      <p>Connecticut reported its single largest increase daily death toll.</p>
<p>Other states we're watching for Tuesday: Massachusetts, Michigan, Georgia, Florida, Texas, Kentucky. https://t.co/iVJQMeS7yQ</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>April 25, 2020, 2:12 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Many states reported a huge number of tests, including a known backlog clearing from MA (30k+). NY reported almost 50k tests; TX over 20k.</p>
<p>AL, CA, FL, GA, IL, MA, NY, TN, TX all reported over 10k tests.</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>May 1, 2020, 2:31 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>Our daily update is published. We’ve now tracked 13.8 million tests, up 343k from yesterday.</p>
<p>5 states showed a decline in total tests due to separating out their antibody results: MI, MO, MS, TX, WV.</p>
<p>Details in this thread. https://t.co/y9aPPSnnor</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 1, 2020, 3:08 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>The number of new cases was low—about 16k—after a series of higher days. The 7-day average fell under 21k.</p>
<p>NY was under 1,000 new cases for the first time in 11 weeks!</p>
<p>California and Texas, which had new highs yesterday, were much lower today. https://t.co/E1yZfBBEym</p>

    <h2>June 3, 2020, 10:42 AM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Another 7 states — HI, ME, MT, NM, SD, UT, WY — are not reporting race / ethnicity for deaths.</p>
<p>TX is reporting but &gt;70% of cases and deaths are listed as unknown.</p>
<p>Some data <em>is</em> better than none, but it's still not enough.</p>

    <h2>June 4, 2020, 2:57 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>States reported fewer than 21k new cases today. The 7-day average fell a bit. After last week's higher numbers, we've seen some lower numbers, especially in the big states like CA and TX. https://t.co/zFXlGJiVJJ</p>

    <h2>June 8, 2020, 3:02 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Our daily update is published. We’ve now tracked 20.6 million tests, up 379k from yesterday, the lowest total in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>One reason for the low number: Texas still hasn't reported.</p>

    <h2>June 10, 2020, 3:20 PM PDT</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Let's take a look at California, Florida, and Texas. CA has a lot of cases, but it also has a lot of people and tests. Florida, though it had a larger outbreak earlier, looks much the same. (We only had a FL hospitalization number for a few days.) https://t.co/xVmyOdMLf8</p>

    </div>
  
    <h2>June 10, 2020, 3:21 PM PDT</h2>

      <p>We also just a number of new cases for Texas—1,826—in line with the state's recent growing numbers.</p>
<p>Arizona remains a trouble spot.</p>

<p>The 7-day average is now at its highest point since May 24.</p>
<p>One important caveat from Texas: 1500 of these cases are older data that local health authorities had not previously reported. https://t.co/Q8bADZ9q3P</p>

      <p>A handful of states reported data for more than one day today, a result of data disruptions caused by the Thanksgiving holiday. On the other hand, CO, NJ, TX, WA, and WY only published partial updates today.</p>

      <p>The past few days have brought an important new set of metrics to state dashboards: vaccine data! So far, we’ve learned of six states—ID, MI, OH, SD, TX and UT—that are posting the number of vaccines administered on their dashboards.</p>

      <p>But this view masks the seriousness of the situation in the three largest southern states. Hospitalizations are rapidly rising in Texas, Florida, and Georgia. https://t.co/MerIVz8tIF</p>

      <p>As of today, vaccine data is readily available across 49 states and territories, but our team only found vaccine data on doses administered in LTCs in seven states: Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.</p>

      <p>The number of people currently hospitalized with COVID-19 in the US is now below 100k for the first time since December 1. Almost all US states are seeing hospitalizations decline or flatten, and CA, FL, and TX all posted big drops today. https://t.co/ZbV4kUoiWh</p>

      <p>Weather-related outages in Texas have resulted in significant case and fatality reporting delays. It's likely that winter storms across the country have partially resulted in artificially low numbers.</p>

    <h2>February 18, 2021, 2:51 PM PST</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We urge caution in interpreting any wobbles in the data in the next week or two, given disruptions from the storms in Texas and elsewhere.</p>

      <p>As previously mentioned, we’ve been unable to update Texas’ testing data for the past 4 days due to the winter storms. Case and death reporting is also likely affected. https://t.co/Ao6yJjqena</p>

    <h2>February 19, 2021, 4:06 PM PST</h2>
    <div>
      <p>In our weekly update, we warned that Texas numbers could be erratic for some time because of the storms and power outages. We recommend keeping an eye on hospitalizations as the sturdiest metric there.</p>

      <p>Data from TX is still a bit wobbly. Total PCR tests (specimens) decreased by 85k without explanation, after increasing by over 400k yesterday.</p>

    <h2>February 23, 2021, 4:07 PM PST</h2>

      <p>Texas reported relatively high numbers for new cases and deaths today, likely due in part to backlog clearing following the recent winter storms. https://t.co/8vBauaqjaH</p>

      <p>Data from Texas is still a bit wobbly due to storm-related reporting disruptions. It's likely that backlogs from the state have affected the 7-day case averages in the South. https://t.co/cFGhEhlZde</p>

      <p>A close look at the topline metrics in Texas shows evidence of major disruption in COVID-19 data reporting across our second-most populous state. When Texas has big problems, they really move the national numbers. https://t.co/b4Tc85tPut</p>
