          <p>​This would be the case if we only used PCR tests to confirm positivity; we also use antigen tests although there are some settings or situations in which only a confirmed PCR test is adequate proof of case positivity or negativity.</p>

          <p>Thus far, our publicly available LTCF data do not break cases into residents vs. staff, although we do have that data (i.e., all the points listed <above>). We are working to provide the overall LTCF data by point values, rather than ranges, on the website after other new reporting priorities are addressed.</p>
<p>We're still not convinced that we should provide these LTCF data at the facility AND point level, since the facilities have pushed back when our numbers do not exactly match theirs. Our conclusion is that it's better to continue providing ranges for cases and deaths at the facility level.</p>

        <div>
          <p>The testing data and case data are compiled as separate datasets. The discrepancy where certain racial/ethnic groups may have a greater # of cases than the # of tests is related to the large quantity of missing race/ethnicity data for tests. Many people tested (~58%) did not have race/ethnicity information provided by the lab facility. However, the case investigation race/ethnicity data are much more complete because RIDOH is asking people directly.</p>

          <p>We follow the CDC and CSTE guidance for case classification, here. The exception is that we are not including non-test-based probables in our case counts and to date we have not separated counts for lab-probable and lab-confirmed criteria. We recommend linking to CDC on our website and leaving it at that, or risk not having the most updated info if the case definition changes.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We're seeing a very large difference between the ICU and bed data from RI's covid dashboard and the data from the CDC.  The difference can be seen here:</p>
<p>https://www.covidexitstrategy.org/</p>
<p>It shows Rhode Island's ICU 83% occupied.  The overall measures of spread such as cases per million seem to be inconsistent as well.</p>
<p>Here is Rhode Island's most recent data on our site:</p>
<p>https://covidtracking.com/data/state/rhode-island</p>
<p>We're trying to figure out what's going on here.  Does this have to do, as you suggested, with overall hospitalization numbers not having to do with covid?  Is there some other health emergency?  We'd just like to make sure we correctly understand Rhode Island's data.</p>

        <div>
          <p>In terms of the ICU bed data, as I mentioned on the phone, CDC reported the number of people who were in the ICU overall and the RIDOH data dashboard reported the number of people in the ICU due to COVID.</p>
<p>(Context from reporter: &quot;When I asked him about this on the phone, he seemed caught off guard and suggested what he answers here- that the number could be overall ICU usage. But I asked him if that was actually the case, and he said he needed to look into it. He didn't answer why the ICU usage was so high here, unfortunately.&quot;)</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Does &quot;total tested&quot; refer to people tested or specimens tested? Are antibody tests included in this figure, and if so does the state have plans to break them out?</p>

          <p>Total tested refers to people tested. Antibody tests are not included in that figure. They plan to put out antibody testing info within the next week.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Given that &quot;Percentages do not include cases with unknown or declined demographics or those that are pending further information&quot;, could RI give the number of such unknown cases / fatalities?
Could RI report n= for cases &amp; fatlities (what is the total that the percentage is of?)</p>

    </div>

        <div>
          <p>1. Unknown or declined demographics question-The number of unknowns/declined are whatever the total is minus the rest of the data.</p>
<p>2. n+ for cases &amp; fatalities question- If you go to bottom of RI dashboard, it says &quot;Click Here&quot;. When you click it, it will take you to their Google spreadsheet. There, in the race and ethnicity data, you can see the denominator to find that number.</p>
