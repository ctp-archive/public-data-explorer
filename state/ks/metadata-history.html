    <div>
      <p>Kansas combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.</p>
<p>Kansas reports most of its data on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays only, so there are often large changes in the values, which can represent 2-3 days of data.</p>
<p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for Kansas reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized. Kansas notes that this metric only includes cases with available discharge information reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.</p>
<p>On March 5, 2021, Kansas noted that a decrease in Deaths (confirmed and probable) was due to a death certificate review which revealed 4 cases where COVID-19 was not the main cause or contributing cause of death.</p>
<p>On December 25, 2020, Kansas announced on their <a href="https://www.coronavirus.kdheks.gov/160/COVID-19-in-Kansas">COVID-19 page</a> that there would be no update to their data on December 25, 2020 due to the holiday.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2020, Kansas’ <strong>Currently hospitalized</strong> decreased by 342 without explanation. Kansas does not usually update their data on Thursdays.</p>
<p>On November 13, 2020, Kansas announced that there was a &quot;technical issue with displaying the number of negative tests and people tested&quot; but that no other metrics were effected. The values for <strong>Total tests (people)</strong>, and the <code>Negative</code> field in the API, were carried over and will be updated if they become available.</p>
<p>On November 12, 2020, Kansas’s <strong>Total tests (people)</strong> and <code>Negative</code> decreased without explanation.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2020, the <strong>Currently in Icu</strong> value for KS dropped from 81 to 1 on the state's dashboard. We recorded it, but expect it to be revised at another point.</p>
<p>On July 15, 2020, Kansas began reporting additional data from hospitals, and at that time, data for the <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> metric was only available through July 10.</p>
<p>From July 1–July 3, 2020, we reported incorrect numbers for Kansas <strong>Cases or Confirmed cases</strong>. We have corrected the error.</p>
<p>As of May 7, 2020, <strong>confirmed and probable cases</strong> are included in the case totals.</p>

      <p>Kansas combines PCR and antigen tests in the total tests figure reported on the state's dashboard.</p>
<p>Kansas reports much of its data on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays only, so there are often large changes in the values, which can represent 2-3 days of data.</p>
<p>As of May 7, 2020, <strong>confirmed and probable cases</strong> are included in the case totals.</p>
<p>From July 1–July 3, 2020, we reported incorrect numbers for Kansas <strong>Cases or Positive PCR tests (people)</strong>. We have corrected the error.</p>
<p>On July 15, 2020, Kansas began reporting additional data from hospitals, and at that time, data for the <strong>Now hospitalized</strong> metric was only available through July 10.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2020, the <strong>inIcuCurrently</strong> value for KS dropped from 81 to 1 on the state's dashboard. We recorded it, but expect it to be revised at another point.</p>
<p>The <strong>Recovered</strong> data point we report for Kansas reflects the number of COVID-19 patients discharged from the hospital and therefore does not represent the total number of people who have recovered from COVID-19, since many people with COVID are never hospitalized. Kansas notes that this metric only includes cases with available discharge information reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.</p>
