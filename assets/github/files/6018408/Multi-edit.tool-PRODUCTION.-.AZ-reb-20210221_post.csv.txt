(7/27 JAC) Deaths went down by one
(7/18 BHP/JAC) We were unable to mouse over cases or deaths to see the confirmed and probable numbers today. It was an issue for everyone and all browsers. Becasue of this we used the total cases for the negative calculation today .
(7/1 BHP) Recoveries updated for 6/25 from 250 to 232. I updated the long formula sheet.
